  - question: What is the purpose of the field function in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The field function in OpenROAD gives you access to the attributes of the object associated with a displayed 
      field or menu item, rather than to the actual value of the field or menu item. It allows you to read or change 
      attributes of the field object.
  - question: Is the field function supported in SQL in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      No, the field function is supported in 4GL but not in SQL in OpenROAD.
  - question: How do you use the field function in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      You use the field function by passing the variable name of the field as an argument to FIELD(). For example:
      FIELD(temperature).TypeFace = TF_LUCIDA;
      This would change the type face of the value settings on a slider field named 'temperature'.
  - question: What's the difference between referencing a field variable directly and using the field function?
    answer: |
      When you reference a field variable directly (e.g., 'temperature'), you're accessing the current value of the 
      field. When you use the field function (e.g., FIELD(temperature)), you're accessing the object that represents 
      the field, allowing you to manipulate its attributes.
  - question: What is the dbmsinfo function in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      The dbmsinfo function in OpenROAD is used to retrieve various pieces of information about the database 
      management system. However, its usage in OpenROAD has some specific restrictions.
  - question: What is the only valid request_name for the dbmsinfo function when used as a standalone statement?
    answer: |
      When used as a standalone statement in OpenROAD, the only valid request_name for the dbmsinfo function is 
      '_bintim'. For example: variable = dbmsinfo('_bintim')
  - question: How can you use the dbmsinfo function to retrieve other information in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      To retrieve other information using the dbmsinfo function in OpenROAD, you need to use it as part of a larger 
      SQL statement. For example, to get the username:
      select logname = dbmsinfo('username')
  - question: What happens if you try to use dbmsinfo with a request_name other than '_bintim' in a standalone statement?
    answer: |
      If you try to use the dbmsinfo function with a request_name other than '_bintim' in a standalone statement in 
      OpenROAD, it will return blanks. For example:
      logname = dbmsinfo('username')
      This statement will return blanks.
  - question: Where can you find more examples and further discussion of the field function in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      More examples and further discussion of the field function can be found in the "Creating Dynamic Frames" 
      section of the Programming Guide for OpenROAD.
  - question: Can the dbmsinfo function be used to retrieve the current user's name in a standalone statement?
    answer: |
      No, the dbmsinfo function cannot be used to retrieve the current user's name in a standalone statement in 
      OpenROAD. To get the username, you must use dbmsinfo as part of a SQL select statement.
