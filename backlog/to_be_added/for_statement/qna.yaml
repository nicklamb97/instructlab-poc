  - question: What is the purpose of the for statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The for statement repeats a series of statements, incrementing or decrementing an index variable until a specified 
      condition is met.
  - question: What is the syntax for the for statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The syntax for the for statement is:
      ```4gl
      [label:] for indexvariable = startexpression
                      to|downto endexpression
                      do statementlist
              endfor;
      ```
  - question: How does the for statement work in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The for statement repetitively executes statements in the statementlist, incrementing (to) or decrementing (downto)
      the indexvariable until the endexpression is met.
  - question: Can you nest for statements in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can nest for statements in Actian OpenROAD 6.2. Each nested loop can have its own index variable and range.
  - question: How do you break out of a for loop in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      You can break out of a for loop using endloop, continue, resume, or return statements. Each serves a different 
      purpose in exiting the loop.
  - question: What does the endloop statement do in a for loop?
    answer: |
      The endloop statement closes the loop immediately and continues execution with the first statement following the 
      endfor statement.
  - question: What does the continue statement do in a for loop?
    answer: |
      The continue statement skips the remaining statements in the loop, increments or decrements the index variable, and 
      begins the next iteration of the loop.
  - question: How can you break out of nested for loops using labels?
    answer: |
      You can use labels with endloop and continue statements to specify which loop to break out of or continue. This helps
      in controlling nested loops.
  - question: What happens if you use the return statement in a for loop?
    answer: |
      The return statement terminates the current frame, procedure, or method, effectively ending the execution of the for 
      loop.
  - question: What are the parameters of the for statement?
    answer: |
      The for statement parameters include label, indexvariable, startexpression, endexpression, and statementlist, each 
      defining specific aspects of the loop's execution.
  - question: Can you provide an example of using the for statement to iterate through an array?
    answer: |
      Here is an example:
      ```4gl
      for i = 1 to array.Lastrow do
           arr[i].PaymentReceived = TRUE;
      endfor;
      ```
  - question: What is the role of the label parameter in the for statement?
    answer: |
      The label parameter identifies each for statement uniquely, allowing endloop or continue statements to reference 
      specific loops in nested scenarios.
  - question: What does the indexvariable parameter specify in the for statement?
    answer: |
      The indexvariable parameter specifies an integer variable that is incremented (to) or decremented (downto) after each
      iteration of the for loop.
  - question: How is the startexpression parameter used in the for statement?
    answer: |
      The startexpression parameter specifies an integer expression to which the indexvariable is set before the first 
      iteration of the for loop.
  - question: How is the endexpression parameter used in the for statement?
    answer: |
      The endexpression parameter specifies an integer expression against which the indexvariable is compared before each
      iteration of the loop.
  - question: What happens when the indexvariable exceeds the endexpression in a for loop?
    answer: |
      When the indexvariable exceeds (to) or becomes less than (downto) the endexpression, the for loop is terminated, 
      stopping further iterations.
