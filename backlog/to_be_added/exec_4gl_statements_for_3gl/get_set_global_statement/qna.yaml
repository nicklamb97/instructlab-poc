  - question: What is the purpose of the get global statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The get global statement retrieves a global variable from Actian 4GL into a 3GL variable.
  - question: What is the syntax for the get global variable statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax is:
      ```4gl
      exec 4gl get global variable (:var[:ind] = name);
      ```
  - question: What is the purpose of the set global statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The set global statement assigns a value from a 3GL variable to a global variable in Actian 4GL.
  - question: What is the syntax for the set global variable statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax is:
      ```4gl
      exec 4gl set global variable (name = :var[:ind]);
      ```
  - question: What is the syntax for the get global constant statement?
    answer: |
      The syntax is:
      ```4gl
      exec 4gl get global constant (:var[:ind] = name);
      ```
  - question: What do the get global and set global statements enable in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      These statements enable 3GL code to access 4GL global variables and constants, including structured data.
  - question: What does the var parameter specify in these statements?
    answer: |
      The var parameter specifies a 3GL variable.
  - question: What does the ind parameter specify in these statements?
    answer: |
      The ind parameter specifies a 3GL null indicator variable.
  - question: What does the name parameter specify in these statements?
    answer: |
      The name parameter specifies the name of the global variable or global constant being retrieved.
  - question: Can you give an example of the get global variable statement?
    answer: |
      Example:
      ```4gl
      exec 4gl get global variable (:var1 = globalVar);
      ```
  - question: Can you give an example of the set global variable statement?
    answer: |
      Example:
      ```4gl
      exec 4gl set global variable (globalVar = :var2);
      ```
  - question: Can you give an example of the get global constant statement?
    answer: |
      Example:
      ```4gl
      exec 4gl get global constant (:var3 = globalConst);
      ```
