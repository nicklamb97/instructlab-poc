  - question: What is the set attribute statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The set attribute statement sets one or more attributes of an object or array in Actian 4GL.
  - question: What is the syntax of the set attribute statement in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The syntax is:
      ```4gl
      exec 4gl set attribute object | array index
                (attribute = :var[:ind])
                [(attribute = :var)][:ind]];
      exec 4gl set attribute object | array index using descriptor;
      ```
  - question: What does the object parameter specify in the set attribute statement?
    answer: |
      The object parameter specifies the handle of the object to which attributes are being set.
  - question: What does the array parameter specify in the set attribute statement?
    answer: |
      The array parameter specifies the handle of the array to which attributes are being set.
  - question: What is the purpose of the index parameter in the set attribute statement?
    answer: |
      The index parameter indicates the row number of the array variable where attributes are being set.
  - question: How does the set attribute statement handle null indicators?
    answer: |
      The set attribute statement handles null indicators using the :ind syntax alongside attribute assignments.
  - question: When should the 'using descriptor' form of the set attribute statement be used?
    answer: |
      The 'using descriptor' form is used to set attributes indicated in the SQLDA descriptor set up by the describe
      statement.
  - question: What type of variables can be assigned to attributes in the set attribute statement?
    answer: |
      Variables compatible with the types of the attributes defined in the object or array can be assigned using the
      set attribute statement.
  - question: Can the set attribute statement set multiple attributes simultaneously?
    answer: |
      Yes, the set attribute statement can set multiple attributes simultaneously using comma-separated attribute
      assignments.
  - question: What happens if the attribute specified in the set attribute statement does not exist in the object or
     array?
    answer: |
      If the attribute specified does not exist, the set attribute statement will result in a runtime error.
  - question: How does the set attribute statement contribute to application development in Actian 4GL?
    answer: |
      The set attribute statement simplifies the process of assigning values to object or array attributes,
      facilitating efficient data management in Actian 4GL applications.
