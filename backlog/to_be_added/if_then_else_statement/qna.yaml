  - question: What is the purpose of the if-then-else statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The if-then-else statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2 chooses between alternative paths of execution based on a specified condition.
  - question: What is the syntax for the if-then-else statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The syntax for the if-then-else statement is:
      ```4gl
      if condition then statementlist
                [{elseif condition then statementlist}]
                [else statementlist]
      endif;
      ```
  - question: How does the if-then-else statement work in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The if-then-else statement executes statementlists based on the evaluation of conditions. It supports nesting and
      handles multiple branching scenarios.
  - question: Can you nest if statements in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can nest if statements in Actian OpenROAD 6.2 to create complex decision-making structures based on 
      multiple conditions.
  - question: What are the parameters of the if-then-else statement?
    answer: |
      The parameters of the if-then-else statement include condition, which is tested for truth, and statementlist,
      which contains the actions executed based on the evaluated condition.
  - question: How does Actian 4GL support conditional branching in OpenROAD?
    answer: |
      Actian 4GL in OpenROAD supports conditional branching through if-then-else statements, allowing developers
      to control program flow based on various logical conditions.
  - question: What variants of the if-then-else statement are supported in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      Actian OpenROAD 6.2 supports variants such as if-then-endif, if-then-else-endif, and if-then-elseif-then-else-endif,
      providing flexibility in handling different branching scenarios.
  - question: How can you use if-then-else statements to control frame flow in OpenROAD applications?
    answer: |
      You can use if-then-else statements to determine which frames to call based on conditions, directing the flow
      of the application dynamically.
  - question: What role does the else part play in the if-then-else statement?
    answer: |
      The else part of the if-then-else statement specifies the actions to be taken if none of the preceding conditions
      evaluate to true.
  - question: Can you provide an example of nesting multiple if statements in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      Here is an example:
      ```4gl
      if status = 'n' then
           if empnum = 0 then
                employee_number = 'None';
           else
                callframe NewEmp;
           endif;
      endif;
      ```
  - question: How does the if-then-else statement enhance application logic in Actian OpenROAD 6.2?
    answer: |
      The if-then-else statement enhances application logic by allowing developers to create sophisticated decision-making
      processes that respond to various conditions and user inputs.
