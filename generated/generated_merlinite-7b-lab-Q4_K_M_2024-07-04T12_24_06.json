Use meaningful and descriptive names that clearly convey the purpose or role of the variable. For example, use `userName` instead of `username` to make it easier to understand.\n3. Avoid using generic names like 'a' or 'b'. Instead, try to come up with names that reflect the contents of the variable, such as `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`.\n4. Use consistent capitalization (e.g., camelCase or PascalCase) to make your code more readable. Avoid using uppercase letters randomly in your variable names, as it can cause confusion and lead to errors when debugging.\n5. Use prefixes or suffixes to indicate the type or scope of variables. For example, use `g_` for global variables, `l_` for local variables, and `p_` for procedural parameters. This way, you can easily distinguish between different types of variables at a glance.\n6. Avoid using names that differ only in case to prevent confusion. Instead, choose consistent and memorable names that are easy to remember.

Use alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) as well as special characters that are allowed within OpenROAD to create more descriptive names, such as \"my_user_account@example.com\".
