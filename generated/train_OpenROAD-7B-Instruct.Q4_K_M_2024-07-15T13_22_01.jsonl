It supports inheritance and polymorphism, which allow you to create complex relationships between objects in your code. Additionally, it has a rich set of built-in functions for performing common tasks quickly and efficiently. In contrast, JavaScript is a dynamically typed language that relies on weak type checking. It does not support inheritance or polymorphism directly but instead uses prototypical inheritance (prototypes) to simulate these concepts. Furthermore, JavaScript lacks built-in functions for many common tasks â€“ forcing developers to write their own code or use third-party libraries instead."}

{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How do you initialize a new object of the specified class?", "assistant": "To create a new instance of an existing class, follow these steps:\n1. Declare a variable of the desired class. This variable should have the same name as the object you want to create. For example:\n   `class <name> = new (`);\nwhere '<name>' is the name of your chosen class.\n2. Use the 'new' keyword with parentheses around it. The 'new' function will allocate memory for your object and initialize its fields with default values or zeros if no initializers were specified in its definition. After successfully declaring your variable, you can use it like any other object in your code.\n3. Call methods on the newly created object as needed. When calling a method, always specify which object you want to act upon by using dot notation (.) between the variable name and the method name:\n   `<variable>.method(parameters);`\nwhere '<variable>' is the name of your declared variable and 'method' represents any valid method for that class.\nBy following these steps, you can easily initialize new objects of any specified class in Actian 4GL."}
