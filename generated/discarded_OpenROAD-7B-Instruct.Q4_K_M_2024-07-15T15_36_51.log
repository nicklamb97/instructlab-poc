The values of these constants are the color codes for the corresponding colors. The integer 1 specifies the base value for all three enumerated types.\nYou can use the members of an enumeration in your code like this:\n```\ncolor = colors.red;\nmessage (color.name) || ' is a beautiful color.';\n```\nIn this example, we first declare a variable called 'color' and assign it to the member 'red' of our previously defined enumeration. Then, we use that variable in a message statement that outputs its name along with some descriptive text about how lovely it is.\n\n"
2024-07-15T16:14:40 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nYou are asked to come up with a set of 5 diverse task instructions under compositional_skills->programming_languages->actian_4gl->for_statement for the task "Write Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement". These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should not have topic diversity. The list should follow the same topic and category.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.\n8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.\n9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.\n\n\nList of 5 tasks:\n'
