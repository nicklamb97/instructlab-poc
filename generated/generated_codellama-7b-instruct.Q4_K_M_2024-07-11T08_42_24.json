        "input": "",
        "output": "To declare a global variable, use the *global* keyword.

This statement changes the background color of a previously described entry field: title = 'Destry Rides Again'; FIELD(title).BgColor = CC_ORANGE; For more information about this function, see Field Function in 4GL Reference.\nTask 18: What is OpenROAD Workbench?\nOpenROAD Workbench is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that you use to design and develop 4GL programs. It allows you to create a variety of objects such as frames, dialogs, entry fields, menus, buttons, and lists. You can also use OpenROAD Workbench to import the data from database tables into your program or export the data from your program into a database table. For more information about this feature, see Data Import/Export in 4GL Reference.\nTask 19: What are global variables?\nGlobal variables are variables that can be accessed and modified from any part of an application. A global variable is not limited to the scope of its creation. For example, the following statement creates a global variable named *i* and initializes it to 0: i = integer;\nTask 20: What are local variables?\nLocal variables are variables that can be accessed and modified only in the block in which they were defined and in any blocks contained by them. Local variables are not visible or accessible from outside the block. For example, the following statement creates a local variable named *i* and initializes it to 0: i = integer;\nTask 21: How do you declare a global variable?\nTo declare a global variable, use the *global* keyword. For example: i = integer not null default 3;\nTask 22: What is an object-oriented programming language?\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is a type of software development in which you organize your application as a collection of objects that can be created and destroyed at will. The objects encapsulate data and code for manipulating the data, while the outside world communicates with them by sending messages to invoke their methods.\nTask 23: What are objects?\nObjects are instances of classes. They have attributes associated with them and are able to perform tasks specified in methods. Objects can be created or destroyed at will. An object-oriented program is a collection of objects, each defined by a class, which together represent the application. For example, a window might be an object.\nTask 24: What is a method?\nA method is a function that belongs to an object. It manipulates data associated with the object. A method can have parameters (input arguments) and can return results (output arguments). Methods are invoked by sending them messages. For example, you can create a window by calling the CreateWindow() method: w = Window.Create(title, height, width);\nTask 25: What is a frame?\nA frame is an object that displays a dialog box with buttons and fields to enter data. The frame script defines what happens when the user clicks a button or selects a field. For example: Button1Click = proc; DoSomething(); END PROC;\nTask 26: How can you create a frame variable?\nTo declare a frame variable, use the *define* statement in the frame script and specify a type for the variable. For example: define integer i not null default 3;\nTask 27: What is a field function?\nA field function is a function that returns the value of a field variable. In addition to referencing objects, you can use\nthe FIELD() function to reference fields or menu items. For more information about this function, see Field Function in 4GL Reference.\nTask 28: How do you set the initial value of a frame variable?\nYou can specify an initial value for a frame variable when you define it using the default clause. For example: i = integer not null default 3; When OpenROAD starts the application, any global variables associated with the frame are initialized to the specified values. Similarly, when you call a procedure or method in a frame, OpenROAD initializes the variables associated with the frame to their default values (which are specified in the define statement).\nTask 29: What is a field?\nA field is a text entry field in a form that can be used by an end user. The value of a field is entered or displayed using a keyboard. A field can be associated with a variable, which contains the data associated with the field. For more information about fields and menu items, see Field Function and Menu Item Function in 4GL Reference.\nTask 30: What is a menu item?\nA menu item is an option on a menu that invokes a method. For example, the File menu might contain items such as Exit or About. When a user selects a menu item, OpenROAD calls the associated method. For more information about fields and menu items, see Field Function and Menu Item Function in 4GL Reference.",

            "# Field and Menu Item Variables\n\nField and menu item variables are variables that are associated with the *value* in a field or menu item. These \nvariables are not associated with the object represented by the field or menu item.\n\nWhen you create a field or menu item in OpenROAD Workbench, you generally specify a variable name on the Property \nInspector. This variable is associated with the data displayed in the field. You can reference this variable in your \n4GL code whenever you need to access the data in the field.\n\nFor example, assume that you create an entry field and enter the variable name as *title*. You can set the value in \nthat field with the following statement:\n\n```\ntitle = 'Destry Rides Again';\n```\n\nIt is not necessary to declare field and menu item variables in your scripts; OpenROAD declares them automatically \nwhen you create the field or menu item in OpenROAD Workbench.\n\nTo reference the object represented by a field or menu item instead of its value, use the FIELD() function, as \ndescribed in Field Function, with the field or menu item variable. For example, the following statement changes the \nbackground color of the previously described entry field:\n\n```\nFIELD(title).BgColor = CC_ORANGE;\n```\n\nFor more information about the field function, see Field Function.\n\n# How You Can Initialize Variables\n\nWhen OpenROAD starts an application, any global variables associated with the application are initialized. Similarly, \nwhen you call a frame or procedure, OpenROAD initializes the variables associated with the frame or procedure.\n\nOpenROAD uses the default value of the variable as the initial setting. For field and menu items or global variables, \nyou can define this value in the OpenROAD Workbench. If you do not, OpenROAD uses the system defaults. OpenROAD also \nuses the system default for variables declared in the initialize statement of a frame script.\n\nFor simple variables, the system defaults are zero for numeric data types, or the empty string ('') for non-nullable \ncharacter data types. However, you can overwrite these defaults using the default clause, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default 3;\n```\n\nFor reference variables, OpenROAD creates an object of the declared class and sets the reference variable to \nreference that object. The attributes of this object are initialized to their default values (which are specified in \nthe class definition). For attributes that are reference variables, you can set the initial value of the variable to \nnull. In this case, no object is created for the reference variable."

For example, the following statement changes the \nbackground color of the previously described entry field:\n\n```\nFIELD(title).BgColor = CC_ORANGE;\n```\n\nFor more information about the field function, see Field Function.\n\n# How You Can Initialize Variables\n\nWhen OpenROAD starts an application, any global variables associated with the application are initialized. Similarly, \nwhen you call a frame or procedure, OpenROAD initializes the variables associated with the frame or procedure.\n\nOpenROAD uses the default value of the variable as the initial setting. For field and menu items or global variables, \nyou can define this value in the OpenROAD Workbench. If you do not, OpenROAD uses the system defaults. OpenROAD also \nuses the system default for variables declared in the initialize statement of a frame script.\n\nFor simple variables, the system defaults are zero for numeric data types, or the empty string ('') for non-nullable \ncharacter data types. However, you can overwrite these defaults using the default clause, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default 3;\n```\n\nFor reference variables, OpenROAD creates an object of the declared class and sets the reference variable to \nreference that object. The attributes of this object are initialized to their default values (which are specified in \nthe class definition). For attributes that are reference variables, you can set the initial value of the variable to \nnull. In this case, no object is created for the reference variable."
