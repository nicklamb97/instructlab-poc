2024-07-15T13:43:47 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nYou are asked to come up with a set of 5 diverse task instructions under compositional_skills->programming_languages->actian_4gl->sleep_statement for the task "Explain the sleep statement in Actian 4GL and its usage in application development.". These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should not have topic diversity. The list should follow the same topic and category.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.\n8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.\n9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.\n\n\nList of 5 tasks:\n'

2024-07-15T13:53:56 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nHow is the duration specified in the sleep statement?\n** Input\nThe duration in the sleep statement must be an integer literal or variable representing the number of seconds to pause.\n\n'
2024-07-15T13:53:56 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nHow can you use the sleep statement to simulate real-world delays and pauses in your application?\n** Input\nYou can use the sleep statement to simulate various types of delays and pauses, such as waiting for a user response or pacing actions within an application. For example, if you want to simulate the time it takes for a printer to finish printing a document, you can use the sleep statement with a duration that matches the estimated print time.\n\n'

2024-07-15T14:36:07 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nFor task 3, follow instructions similar to those provided above for tasks 1 and 2. When completing these instructions, make sure not to repeat any verbs used previously so as not to confuse GPT models trying to understand how they should interact with you or other objects in your environment. Additionally, try using different types of instructions such as questions instead of imperative ones when possible. This will help ensure maximum diversity in the set of 5 tasks while also keeping the language used for each instruction varied.\n'

The caption should be "E-Mail Address".\n* Ask the user to provide their e-mail address in this field.\n* Once they have done so, save the value of the variable associated with this field into your database using the following SQL statement:\nINSERT INTO email (email) VALUES (?);\nWhere \'?\' is a placeholder for the actual value of the variable.\n* After saving the data, you can use it later in your program whenever you need to send e-mails or perform other actions related to e-mail addresses. For example, when you want to notify users about new features or changes in your application, simply use the e-mail address variable as an argument for any relevant functions or methods.\n* Note that this instruction does not require input because it provides a specific context and task. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse, combining questions with imperative instructions.\n\n\nTask 4:\nCreate two radio buttons with labels \'Yes\' and \'No\'. The caption should be "Would you like pizza for dinner tonight?".\nTask 5:\nAsk the user to choose one of the two options presented by your previous instruction. When they make their selection, save its result into your database using the following SQL statement:\nUPDATE user SET wants_pizza = ?;\nWhere \'?\' is a placeholder for the actual value of the variable.\nTask 6:\nAfter saving the data, you can use it later in your program whenever you need to make decisions based on user preferences or perform other actions related to pizza deliveries. For example, when you want to order pizzas for an event like a party or celebration, simply use the \'wants_pizza\' variable as an argument for any relevant functions or methods.\nTask 7:\nNote that this instruction does not require input because it provides a specific context and task. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse, combining questions with imperative instructions.\n\n\nList of 5 tasks:\n'
2024-07-15T15:33:41 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nPlease describe the process of adding a new field to an existing object.\ninput\nYou want to add a field called 'color' with values red, blue and green.\noutput\nTo accomplish this task, follow these steps:\n1. Open your actian console and locate the object you want to modify. In this example, we will assume it is a sheep.\n2. Type `sheep = new Sheep();` into your console. This creates a new Sheep object in memory for you.\n3. Now, let's add our 'color' field to it. We can do this with the following line of code:\n```\nsheep.fields['color'] = ['red', 'blue', 'green'];\n```\nwhere 'sheep' is again your variable name. This adds three options (or colors) into its field called color. Now when you call any method on this sheep, such as speak() or walk(), it will use one of these colors randomly selected from within its field. You can also set the initial value for any field by specifying it when you create your object. For example, if we want our sheep's eyes to be orange instead of default blue, we could do:\n```\nsheep.fields['eyes'] = 'orange';\n```\n4. After adding fields to your objects, you can access their values using dot notation. For example, to get the current color of our sheep, you would type:\n```\nsheep.fields['color'].value;\n```\nwhere 'sheep' is again your variable name. This will return either 'red', 'blue' or 'green'. You can also use this syntax for reading from or writing into any field on an object.\n"
