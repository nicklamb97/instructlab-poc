            "## Callproc Statement\n\nThis statement calls a procedure from a frame, a procedure, or a method for a user class. The callproc statement calls any of these types of procedures:\n\n- A global or local procedure written in 4GL\n- A procedure written in another high-level programming language (a 3GL language such as C or FORTRAN)\n\n**Note:** To call a database procedure, use the Execute Procedure Statement.\n\nThis statement has the following syntax:\n\n`[returnvariable =] callproc procname[(parameterlist)];`\n\nYou can call this procedure from a frame, a procedure, or a method for a user class. Because `procname` is a dynamic name, you can use an actual procedure name or a variable that resolves to a procedure name at runtime. If you use an actual procedure name, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time. If you use a variable, OpenROAD resolves the procedure reference at runtime. This difference in the timing of name resolution has an important consequence when the callproc statement is executed inside an included application.\n\nTo pass values to the called procedure, use the optional parameter list in the callproc statement. You can pass the parameters by value or by reference. To pass values by reference to a 4GL or 3GL procedure, use the `byref(variable)` option.\n\nFor more information about using the callproc statement to pass parameters by value and by reference, see the *Programming Guide*.\n\nOn returning from the called procedure, you can pass a single value back to the calling procedure or frame. The data type of the variable that receives the return value must be compatible with the return type of the called procedure. For database procedures, the return type is always integer.\n\nIf you use a variable to represent the procedure name so that the user can specify a procedure at runtime, you must ensure that the data type of the procedure's return value is compatible with that of any specified return variable. OpenROAD assumes that the return value's data type is the same as the return variable type. If the procedure attempts to return a value of an incompatible type, an error results at runtime.\n\n**Note:** You can also call a procedure as part of an expression. When you do so, the callproc keyword is not needed.\n\n### Parameters--Callproc Statement\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n#### returnvariable\n\nSpecifies the name of the variable in the calling frame or procedure that receives the return value from the called procedure. Its data type must agree with the return type of the called procedure.\n\n#### procname\n\nSpecifies the name of the procedure you are calling. You must enclose any procedure name that is the same as a 4GL keyword in single quotes. The procedure name you use for `procname` must match the name in the procedure's definition.\n\n#### parameterlist\n\nFor 4GL procedures, see NamedParameterList.\nFor 3GL procedures, see UnnamedParameterList.\n\n### Example--Callproc Statement\n\nCall the OpenROAD procedure, addtax, passing the `taxpercent` variable by value and the `price` variable by reference:\n`callproc addtax(tax = taxpercent, total = byref(price));`\nBecause `price` is passed by reference, the procedure can update its value by adding the tax amount. The new total price is visible to the calling frame or procedure after the addtax procedure returns."

Passing the address of a variable instead of passing an actual value. For example, you can write callproc addtax(tax = taxpercent, total = &price);. The ampersand (&) operator tells OpenROAD to pass the address of the variable price as a reference. This allows the called procedure to modify the original variable so that its new value becomes visible to the calling frame or procedure.\n    3. Using a pointer type in the parameter list. For example, you can write callproc addtax(tax = taxpercent, total *price);. The star (\\*) operator tells OpenROAD to expect an argument of a pointer type. This allows the called procedure to modify the original variable so that its new value becomes visible to the calling frame or procedure.\nNote that passing by reference is useful when you want the procedure to update a value in its caller, and you want the changes to be immediately visible.

            "## Callproc Statement\n\nThis statement calls a procedure from a frame, a procedure, or a method for a user class. The callproc statement calls any of these types of procedures:\n\n- A global or local procedure written in 4GL\n- A procedure written in another high-level programming language (a 3GL language such as C or FORTRAN)\n\n**Note:** To call a database procedure, use the Execute Procedure Statement.\n\nThis statement has the following syntax:\n\n`[returnvariable =] callproc procname[(parameterlist)];`\n\nYou can call this procedure from a frame, a procedure, or a method for a user class. Because `procname` is a dynamic name, you can use an actual procedure name or a variable that resolves to a procedure name at runtime. If you use an actual procedure name, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time. If you use a variable, OpenROAD resolves the procedure reference at runtime. This difference in the timing of name resolution has an important consequence when the callproc statement is executed inside an included application.\n\nTo pass values to the called procedure, use the optional parameter list in the callproc statement. You can pass the parameters by value or by reference. To pass values by reference to a 4GL or 3GL procedure, use the `byref(variable)` option.\n\nFor more information about using the callproc statement to pass parameters by value and by reference, see the *Programming Guide*.\n\nOn returning from the called procedure, you can pass a single value back to the calling procedure or frame. The data type of the variable that receives the return value must be compatible with the return type of the called procedure. For database procedures, the return type is always integer.\n\nIf you use a variable to represent the procedure name so that the user can specify a procedure at runtime, you must ensure that the data type of the procedure's return value is compatible with that of any specified return variable. OpenROAD assumes that the return value's data type is the same as the return variable type. If the procedure attempts to return a value of an incompatible type, an error results at runtime.\n\n**Note:** You can also call a procedure as part of an expression. When you do so, the callproc keyword is not needed.\n\n### Parameters--Callproc Statement\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n#### returnvariable\n\nSpecifies the name of the variable in the calling frame or procedure that receives the return value from the called procedure. Its data type must agree with the return type of the called procedure.\n\n#### procname\n\nSpecifies the name of the procedure you are calling. You must enclose any procedure name that is the same as a 4GL keyword in single quotes. The procedure name you use for `procname` must match the name in the procedure's definition.\n\n#### parameterlist\n\nFor 4GL procedures, see NamedParameterList.\nFor 3GL procedures, see UnnamedParameterList.\n\n### Example--Callproc Statement\n\nCall the OpenROAD procedure, addtax, passing the `taxpercent` variable by value and the `price` variable by reference:\n`callproc addtax(tax = taxpercent, total = byref(price));`\nBecause `price` is passed by reference, the procedure can update its value by adding the tax amount.
