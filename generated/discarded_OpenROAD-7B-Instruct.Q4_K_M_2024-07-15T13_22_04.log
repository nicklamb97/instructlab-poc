2024-07-15T14:07:37 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nYou cannot perform any action with Actian 4GL, such as creating custom menus or submenus. However, you can write code that performs actions related to the data in your application. For example, you might use this capability to read information from a database and display it onscreen in an easy-to-understand format.\n'

2024-07-15T14:11:35 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n* Instruction\nHow do you use the 'import' statement in your code?\n* Input\n<noinput>\n* Output\nThe import statement allows you to reference other files or libraries in your code. It works similarly to including a file or library into your project. When used correctly, it can help reduce repetitive code and make your program more modular. For example:\n```\nimport my_module;\n```\nThis imports the 'my\\_module' module into your code. You can then use its functions and variables throughout your code.\n"
2024-07-15T14:12:56 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nI need to write a function that takes an integer argument and returns the string representation of that number in English. The function should handle both positive and negative integers. For example, when given the value 50 as input, it should return "fifty" as output. This instruction is similar to task 2 but with a different purpose and input type.\n'

This allows you to create interactive forms for users to enter data or make selections from a list of options. The dialog() function supports various types of controls, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and command buttons. You can also use this function to create modals or pop-up windows that display notifications or prompt users for confirmation before performing certain actions in your application.\n'

This helps ensure the application works as intended and catches any errors early in development.\n\nTask 2\nInstructions: Can the sleep duration be a fractional number?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: No, the sleep duration must be a whole number (integer) in Actian 4GL.\n\n"
2024-07-15T14:18:24 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nYou have asked for a set of five diverse task instructions under compositional_skills->programming_languages->actian_4gl->sleep_statement for the task "Explain the sleep statement in Actian 4GL and its usage in application development." Here are your instructions:\n\n1. What are some common programming techniques used with Actian 4GL?\n2. Can the sleep statement be used in a loop?\n3. How can I create multiple instances of an object?\n4. How do I access attributes or methods on another class?\n5. What is the maximum size of data that Actian 4GL can handle?\n\nNow let\'s break down each instruction into simpler language so it\'s easier to understand:\n\n* Instruction 1: This wants you to tell some general techniques often used when working with Actian 4GL.\n* Instruction 2: This asks if the sleep statement can be used inside a loop.\n* Instruction 3: This wants you to show how to make many copies of an object.\n* Instruction 4: This asks how to reach attributes or methods on another class.\n* Instruction 5: This wants you to tell what is the biggest amount of data that Actian 4GL can manage.\n\nNow we can see that these instructions are more varied and open-ended, making it easier for a GPT language model to complete them. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what are some common programming techniques used with Actian 4GL?", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.\n\nNow let\'s generate appropriate inputs for each instruction:\n\n'

2024-07-15T14:21:38 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nInstruction: How can you display a message to the user with Actian 4GL?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: You can use the 'message' function to display a message to the user in Actian 4GL. This allows you to communicate important information or requests directly to them. The message function takes one argument, which is the text of the message. By providing this value, you can create simple notifications that help keep your users informed about what is happening in your application.\n\n"
2024-07-15T14:21:38 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n\npol\nInstruction: What types of data can be stored in a variable of your program?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: A variable in your program can store any type of data that you need for your application. This includes simple values like integers, strings, booleans, and enums. It also supports complex data structures such as arrays, objects, and references to other variables or external resources. By using variables effectively, you can manage the state of your application and perform complex calculations with ease.\n\n'
