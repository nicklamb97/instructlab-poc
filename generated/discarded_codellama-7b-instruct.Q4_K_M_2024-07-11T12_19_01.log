These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should be similar to provided examples. The generated instruction and the output should be grounded in the provided document.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. The output should be an appropriate response to the input and the instruction. Long outputs are preferable.\n\nBased on below document provide a list of 5 tasks:\n\nDocument:\nWhat is a Conditional Statement?\n------------------------------\nA conditional statement is a type of programming construct that enables you to make decisions during your application\'s execution. This page contains information on what a conditional statement is, how it works, and examples of how to use the If-Then-Else and Case statements in Actian 4GL OpenROAD.\n\nThe most basic form of a conditional statement is an if-then statement. The if keyword indicates that you are entering a conditional block of code. The then keyword starts a block of code that will be executed if the condition following the if keyword evaluates to true. The else keyword marks a block of code that will be executed if the condition following the if keyword evaluates to false or null.\n\nA common example of an if-then statement is a simple error message. If you expect user input, and that input is invalid, you can use an if-then statement to display a friendly error message instead of showing an ugly error message. The if-then statement works like this:\n```\nif myvar < 0 then\n     msgbox "The value must be greater than zero";\nendif;\n```\nIn this example, the program checks whether the value stored in the variable myvar is less than zero. If it is, then the program displays a message box containing the error message "The value must be greater than zero." If myvar is greater than or equal to zero, then no message appears. This if-then statement ensures that you can display an error message in only one place, rather than having multiple locations for displaying this message.\n\nAnother common use of conditional statements is to handle different types of data. For example, a program might look at the type of a variable and execute different code based on the type. A simple example is shown below:\n```\nif typeof(myvar) = \'number\' then\n     msgbox "The value must be a number";\nelseif typeof(myvar) = \'text\' then\n     msgbox "The value must be text";\nendif;\n```\nIn this example, the program looks at the type of variable myvar and executes different code based on what it is. If myvar is a number, an error message displays indicating that it cannot process a number. If myvar is text, another message displays indicating that it cannot process text. This helps to keep your application organized, rather than having multiple blocks of code checking the type of variable and acting accordingly.\n'

These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should be similar to provided examples. The generated instruction and the output should be grounded in the provided document.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. The output should be an appropriate response to the input and the instruction. Long outputs are preferable.\n\n\nBased on below document provide a list of 5 tasks:\n\nDocument:\n## If-Then-Else Statement\n\nThis statement chooses between alternative paths of execution. You can use the if-then-else statement to control the flow of an application by establishing a variety of logical relationships.\n\nThis statement has the following syntax:\n```\nif condition then statementlist\n          [{elseif condition then statementlist}]\n          [else statementlist]\nendif;\n```\nYou can nest if statements.\n\n### Parameters--If-Then-Else Statement\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n#### condition\n\nSee Condition. This condition is tested to determine which statementlist is executed.\n\n#### statementlist\n\nSee StatementList.\n\n### Variants--If-Then-Else Statement\n\nThe if-then-else statement has the following variants:\n\n#### if-then-endif\n\nThe if statement tests for the truth of an expression. If the expression is true, OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the then keyword up to the endif statement. If the expression is false or null, OpenROAD executes the statements after the endif statement.\n\n#### if-then-else-endif\n\nIf the expression in the if statement is true, 4GL executes the set of statements following the then keyword up to the else keyword. If the expression is false or null, OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the else keyword up to the endif keyword.\n\n#### if-then-elseif-then-else-endif\n\nIf the expression in the if statement is true, OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the then keyword up to the elseif keyword. If the expression is false or null, then OpenROAD tests the expression that starts with the elseif keyword. If this expression is true, OpenROAD executes the set of statements up to the else keyword.\n\nIf both conditions are false or null, then OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the else keyword up to the endif keyword.\n\n### Examples--If-Then-Else Statement\n\nSet a status variable if no employee number was entered in the empnum field:\n```\nif empnum = 0 then\n     employee_number = \'None\';\nendif;\n```\nPrompt for a value if no employee number was entered in the empnum field:\n```\nif empnum = 0 then\n     enum = prompt \'Please enter employee number\';\nendif;\n```\nControl the flow of frames within an application based on the value in the status variable in the current frame:\n```\nif status = \'n\' then\n     callframe new;\nelseif status = \'c\' then\n     callframe completed;\nelse\n     callframe inprogress;\nendif;\n```\nNest multiple if statements:\n```\nif status = \'n\' then\n     if empnum = 0 then\n          employee_number = \'None\';\n     else\n          callframe NewEmp;\n     endif;\nendif;\n\n```\n\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n'

The if-then-else statement differs from other programming languages like C or Java in that it is capable of nesting multiple if statements within each other. This makes the statement more versatile and powerful, as you can create complex conditions based on a series of tests. You can use this capability to implement a variety of algorithms and control the flow of an application based on a combination of logical variables.\n3. In Actian 4GL, you might use if-then-else statements to set a status variable if no employee number was entered in the empnum field of a form. For example,\n```\nif empnum = 0 then\n     employee_number = 'None';\nendif;\n```\nOr you might use it to call different frames based on a variable in the current frame:\n```\nif status = 'n' then\n     callframe new;\nelseif status = 'c' then\n     callframe completed;\nelse\n     callframe inprogress;\nendif;\n```\nThese examples demonstrate how you can use the if-then-else statement to implement more sophisticated decisions and control the flow of an application based on a combination of logical variables."

This is useful when there are multiple conditions to consider before making a decision. Nested if statements can be used to make decisions that involve multiple levels of logic. For example, you might have a program that makes decisions based on the time of day or the current weather. By using nested if statements, you can create more complex expressions that evaluate these factors and then take action based on the result.\n'

Please provide me with a revised document with more detailed information so that I can give you the answers.\n\n<|system|>\nHere is a revised version of the document that includes more detailed information:\n\n## If-Then-Else Statement\n\nThis statement chooses between alternative paths of execution. You can use the if-then-else statement to control the flow of an application by establishing a variety of logical relationships. The following is an example of this statement's usage and its syntax.\n\n### Usage--If-Then-Else Statement\n\nYou can use an if-then-else statement in your code for the following purposes:\n1. To control flow. You can determine what to execute based on a condition.\n2. To test conditions. If you need to test multiple conditions, you can create more than one if-then-else statement.\n3. To specify a set of statements to execute if all conditions are true or false or null. You can use an elseif clause to test each condition in turn, starting with the first. When the first condition is true, OpenROAD executes the set of statements that follow the then keyword until it reaches the endif statement or the next elseif keyword. If this condition is false or null and another condition follows, OpenROAD tests the condition specified after the next elseif clause; otherwise, it checks the condition in the else keyword.\n4. To provide different results based on a variety of conditions. You can use multiple if-then-else clauses to execute different sets of statements.\n5. To execute code depending on the state of an application. If you have an application that runs at different stages, you can test the status and take appropriate actions by using an if-then-else statement. For example, a payment application might prompt the user for information or change states depending on whether there is enough money in the account.\n\n### Parameters--If-Then-Else Statement\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n#### condition\n\nSee Condition. This condition is tested to determine which statementlist is executed.\n\n#### statementlist\n\nSee StatementList.\n\n### Variants--If-Then-Else Statement\n\nThe if-then-else statement has the following variants:\n\n#### if-then-endif\n\nThe if statement tests for the truth of an expression. If the expression is true, OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the then keyword up to the endif statement. If the expression is false or null, OpenROAD executes the statements after the endif statement.\n\n#### if-then-else-endif\n\nIf the expression in the if statement is true, 4GL executes the set of statements following the then keyword up to the else keyword. If the expression is false or null, OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the else keyword up to the endif keyword.\n\n#### if-then-elseif-then-else-endif\n\nIf the expression in the if statement is true, OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the then keyword up to the elseif keyword. If the expression is false or null, then OpenROAD tests the expression that starts with the elseif keyword. If this expression is true, OpenROAD executes the set of statements up to the else keyword.\n\nIf both conditions are false or null, then OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the else keyword up to the endif keyword.\n\n### Examples--If-Then-Else Statement\n\nSet a status variable if no employee number was entered in the empnum field:\n```\nif empnum = 0 then\n     employee_number = 'None';\nendif;\n```\nPrompt for a value if no employee number was entered in the empnum field:\n```\nif empnum = 0 then\n     enum = prompt 'Please enter employee number';\nendif;\n```\nControl the flow of frames within an application based on the value in the status variable in the current frame:\n```\nif status = 'n' then\n     callframe new;\nelseif status = 'c' then\n     callframe completed;\nelse\n     callframe inprogress;\nendif;\n```\nNest multiple if statements:\n```\nif status = 'n' then\n     if empnum = 0 then\n          employee_number = 'None';\n     else\n          callframe NewEmp;\n     endif;\nendif;\n\n```"

If the expression is true, OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the then keyword up to the endif statement. If the expression is false or null, OpenROAD executes the statements after the endif statement.\n\n#### if-then-else-endif\n\nIf the expression in the if statement is true, 4GL executes the set of statements following the then keyword up to the else keyword. If the expression is false or null, OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the else keyword up to the endif keyword.\n\n#### if-then-elseif-then-else-endif\n\nIf the expression in the if statement is true, OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the then keyword up to the elseif keyword. If the expression is false or null, then OpenROAD tests the expression that starts with the elseif keyword. If this expression is true, OpenROAD executes the set of statements up to the else keyword.\n\nIf both conditions are false or null, then OpenROAD executes the set of statements following the else keyword up to the endif keyword.\n\n### Examples--If-Then-Else Statement\n\nSet a status variable if no employee number was entered in the empnum field:\n```\nif empnum = 0 then\n     employee_number = 'None';\nendif;\n```\nPrompt for a value if no employee number was entered in the empnum field:\n```\nif empnum = 0 then\n     enum = prompt 'Please enter employee number';\nendif;\n```\nControl the flow of frames within an application based on the value in the status variable in the current frame:\n```\nif status = 'n' then\n     callframe new;\nelseif status = 'c' then\n     callframe completed;\nelse\n     callframe inprogress;\nendif;\n```\nNest multiple if statements:\n```\nif status = 'n' then\n     if empnum = 0 then\n          employee_number = 'None';\n     else\n          callframe NewEmp;\n     endif;\nendif;\n\n```\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n"
