Exact numeric data types include decimals (p,s), floats (float4), and integers. Approximate numeric data types include floating point numbers (float8, double precision).\nFloating point numbers are stored in four or eight bytes depending on the type and specified precision. Decimal numbers are not stored in floating point format but are stored as strings. Exact decimal numbers are rounded to 15 decimal places before storing."}

The main differences between them are their precision and storage sizes. \nFloat4 (real) is a four-byte floating point number with precision up to 23 decimals. It stores more numbers with less space.\nOn the other hand, Float (double precision) is an eight-byte floating point number with precision up to 53 decimals. It stores larger numbers with more accuracy, but occupies more memory. \nIn general, float4 is a better choice for smaller values, while float is a better choice for larger ones."}
