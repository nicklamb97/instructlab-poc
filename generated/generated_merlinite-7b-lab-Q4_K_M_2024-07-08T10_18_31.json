Reduced development time and effort: Developers don't need to worry about consistently capitalizing or lowercasing keywords, which saves time and reduces the risk of introducing typos during the programming process.\n3.

For example, use < or > instead of BETWEEN when you want to compare integer values.\n3. **Avoid unnecessary calculations**: In your conditions, avoid performing unnecessary calculations that can affect performance. Instead, calculate the result outside the condition and use it in your condition.\n4. **Use descriptive names for your conditions**: Make your code readable by using clear and concise names for your conditions. This will help you and others understand what your code is doing at a glance.\n5. **Test your logic**: Always test your logic to ensure that it works as expected. Use debugging tools, such as print statements or logging, to check the flow of your program and identify any issues.\n6. **Optimize for readability**: Organize your code in a way that makes it easy to understand, especially when dealing with complex logical flows.

            "# IF-THEN-ELSE Statement in Actian 4GL\n\nThe IF-THEN-ELSE statement is a fundamental control structure in Actian 4GL that allows for conditional execution of \ncode blocks based on specified conditions. This structure is crucial for directing the flow of a program, enabling it \nto make decisions and execute specific code segments accordingly.\n\n## Basic Syntax\n\nThe basic syntax of the IF-THEN-ELSE statement in Actian 4GL is as follows:\n\n```4gl\nIF condition THEN\n    statements\nELSE IF condition THEN\n    statements\nELSE\n    statements\nEND IF\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n### Optional Clauses\n\n- The ELSE IF and ELSE clauses are optional.\n- An IF statement can be as simple as a single condition and a single block of statements to execute if that condition \nis true.\n- Multiple ELSE IF clauses can be included to check additional conditions sequentially.\n\n### Boolean Evaluation\n\n- Conditions must evaluate to a boolean value (TRUE or FALSE).\n- Conditions are typically composed of comparisons or logical expressions.\n\n### Case-Insensitivity\n\n- Actian 4GL is case-insensitive for keywords, so IF, if, and If are all valid, though conventionally, all caps should \nbe used for readability and consistency.\n\n## Condition Evaluation\n\nConditions in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement are evaluated in sequence from top to bottom. As soon as a true condition is \nfound, the corresponding block of statements is executed, and the remaining conditions are ignored.\n\n## Comparison Operators\n\nComparison operators are used to form conditions that compare values. The primary comparison operators in Actian 4GL \ninclude:\n\n- `=` : Equal to\n- `!=` or `<>` : Not equal to\n- `<` : Less than\n- `>` : Greater than\n- `<=` : Less than or equal to\n- `>=` : Greater than or equal to\n\n## Logical Operators\n\nLogical operators are used to combine multiple conditions or invert a condition:\n\n- `AND` : Logical AND\n- `OR` : Logical OR\n- `NOT` : Logical NOT"
