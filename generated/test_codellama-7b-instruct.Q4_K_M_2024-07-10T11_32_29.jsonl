It creates a multiplication table by\niterating over two ranges from 1 to 5, displaying the values of i and j and their product.\n"}

Variable declaration: Actian 4GL requires explicit variable definition with 'DEFINE', while C# declares\n   variables within the loop statement.\n3. Output: Actian 4GL uses 'DISPLAY', while C# uses 'Console.WriteLine'.\n4. String interpolation: C# uses string interpolation with $, while Actian 4GL concatenates values.\n"}
