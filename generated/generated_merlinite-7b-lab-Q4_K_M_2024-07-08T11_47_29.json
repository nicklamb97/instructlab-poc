            "# Variables in Expressions\n\nYou can use simple variables alone or in expressions. In the following example, the age variable appears alone on the \nleft side and is an element in the expression \"age + 1\" on the right of the assignment statement:\n\n```\nage = age + 1;\n```\n\nOpenROAD uses the current value of age to compute a new value that replaces the current value.\n\nYou can use the simple variables that are elements of reference or array variables in the same way, for example:\n\n```\ntotal = 0;\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= emptable.LastRow do\n    total = total + emptable[i].salary;\n    i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n\nIn this example, the value in the salary column from the emptable table field is added to the total field as part of \na while loop.\n\n# Procedures in Expressions\n\nWhen a procedure returns a value, such as a return code, it functions as an expression. In the following syntax \nexample, procname is the name of a procedure that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = procname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a procedure as part of an expression, the following rules apply:\n\n- Do not use the callproc keyword.\n- Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.\n- Explicitly name the procedure. You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In this syntax example, methodname is a method that returns \na numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a method returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator gets a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",
            "If any of the simple variables is null, the result of any comparison involving them is null, for example:\n\n```\ncount = null;\nif count + 1 > 0 then\n    callframe newproject;\nendif;\n```\n\nBecause count is null, the result of the comparison that includes count is null. Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon. However, \nthe field function is not allowed in database statements, nor are procedure or method invocations. SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression. Expressions are used in many contexts, \nsuch as specifying values to be retrieved (in a SELECT clause) or compared (in a WHERE clause). For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT empname, empage FROM employee\nWHERE salary > 75000\n```\n\nIn the preceding example, empname and empage are expressions representing the column values to be retrieved, salary \nis an expression representing a column value to be compared, and 75000 is an integer literal expression.\n\nExpressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses, and aggregate functions \ncannot be nested.\n\nAn expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value."

For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type.

That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator gets a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",

Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon.

SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression.

            "# Variables in Expressions\n\nYou can use simple variables alone or in expressions. In the following example, the age variable appears alone on the \nleft side and is an element in the expression \"age + 1\" on the right of the assignment statement:\n\n```\nage = age + 1;\n```\n\nOpenROAD uses the current value of age to compute a new value that replaces the current value.\n\nYou can use the simple variables that are elements of reference or array variables in the same way, for example:\n\n```\ntotal = 0;\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= emptable.LastRow do\n    total = total + emptable[i].salary;\n    i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n\nIn this example, the value in the salary column from the emptable table field is added to the total field as part of \na while loop.\n\n# Procedures in Expressions\n\nWhen a procedure returns a value, such as a return code, it functions as an expression. In the following syntax \nexample, procname is the name of a procedure that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = procname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a procedure as part of an expression, the following rules apply:\n\n- Do not use the callproc keyword.\n- Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.\n- Explicitly name the procedure. You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type.

That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator gets a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",
            "If any of the simple variables is null, the result of any comparison involving them is null, for example:\n\n```\ncount = null;\nif count + 1 > 0 then\n    callframe newproject;\nendif;\n```\n\nBecause count is null, the result of the comparison that includes count is null. Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon. However, \nthe field function is not allowed in database statements, nor are procedure or method invocations. SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression. Expressions are used in many contexts, \nsuch as specifying values to be retrieved (in a SELECT clause) or compared (in a WHERE clause). For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT empname, empage FROM employee\nWHERE salary > 75000\n```\n\nIn the preceding example, empname and empage are expressions representing the column values to be retrieved, salary \nis an expression representing a column value to be compared, and 75000 is an integer literal expression.\n\nExpressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses, and aggregate functions \ncannot be nested.\n\nAn expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value."

You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type.

That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator gets a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used.

In the following example, the age variable appears alone on the \nleft side and is an element in the expression \"age + 1\" on the right of the assignment statement:\n\n```\nage = age + 1;\n```\n\nOpenROAD uses the current value of age to compute a new value that replaces the current value.\n\nYou can use the simple variables that are elements of reference or array variables in the same way, for example:\n\n```\ntotal = 0;\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= emptable.LastRow do\n    total = total + emptable[i].salary;\n    i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n\nIn this example, the value in the salary column from the emptable table field is added to the total field as part of \na while loop.\n\n# Procedures in Expressions\n\nWhen a procedure returns a value, such as a return code, it functions as an expression. In the following syntax \nexample, procname is the name of a procedure that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = procname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a procedure as part of an expression, the following rules apply:\n\n- Do not use the callproc keyword.\n- Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.\n- Explicitly name the procedure. You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In this syntax example, methodname is a method that returns \na numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a method returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator gets a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",
            "If any of the simple variables is null, the result of any comparison involving them is null, for example:\n\n```\ncount = null;\nif count + 1 > 0 then\n    callframe newproject;\nendif;\n```\n\nBecause count is null, the result of the comparison that includes count is null. Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon. However, \nthe field function is not allowed in database statements, nor are procedure or method invocations. SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression. Expressions are used in many contexts, \nsuch as specifying values to be retrieved (in a SELECT clause) or compared (in a WHERE clause). For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT empname, empage FROM employee\nWHERE salary > 75000\n```\n\nIn the preceding example, empname and empage are expressions representing the column values to be retrieved, salary \nis an expression representing a column value to be compared, and 75000 is an integer literal expression.\n\nExpressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses, and aggregate functions \ncannot be nested.\n\nAn expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value."

In the following syntax \nexample, procname is the name of a procedure that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = procname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a procedure as part of an expression, the following rules apply:\n\n- Do not use the callproc keyword.\n- Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.\n- Explicitly name the procedure. You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In this syntax example, methodname is a method that returns \na numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a method returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator gets a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",
            "If any of the simple variables is null, the result of any comparison involving them is null, for example:\n\n```\ncount = null;\nif count + 1 > 0 then\n    callframe newproject;\nendif;\n```\n\nBecause count is null, the result of the comparison that includes count is null. Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon. However, \nthe field function is not allowed in database statements, nor are procedure or method invocations. SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression. Expressions are used in many contexts, \nsuch as specifying values to be retrieved (in a SELECT clause) or compared (in a WHERE clause). For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT empname, empage FROM employee\nWHERE salary > 75000\n```\n\nIn the preceding example, empname and empage are expressions representing the column values to be retrieved, salary \nis an expression representing a column value to be compared, and 75000 is an integer literal expression.\n\nExpressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses, and aggregate functions \ncannot be nested.\n\nAn expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value."

In the following syntax \nexample, procname is the name of a procedure that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = procname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a procedure as part of an expression, the following rules apply:\n\n- Do not use the callproc keyword.\n- Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.\n- Explicitly name the procedure. You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type.

For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",
            "If any of the simple variables is null, the result of any comparison involving them is null, for example:\n\n```\ncount = null;\nif count + 1 > 0 then\n    callframe newproject;\nendif;\n```\n\nBecause count is null, the result of the comparison that includes count is null. Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon.

In the following example, the age variable appears alone on the \nleft side and is an element in the expression \"age + 1\" on the right of the assignment statement:\n\n```\nage = age + 1;\n```\n\nOpenROAD uses the current value of age to compute a new value that replaces the current value.\n\nYou can use the simple variables that are elements of reference or array variables in the same way, for example:\n\n```\ntotal = 0;\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= emptable.LastRow do\n    total = total + emptable[i].salary;\n    i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n\nIn this example, the value in the salary column from the emptable table field is added to the total field as part of \na while loop.\n\n# Procedures in Expressions\n\nWhen a procedure returns a value, such as a return code, it functions as an expression. In the following syntax \nexample, procname is the name of a procedure that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = procname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a procedure as part of an expression, the following rules apply:\n\n- Do not use the callproc keyword.\n- Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.\n- Explicitly name the procedure. You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression.

In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable.

For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type.

To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",

You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In this syntax example, methodname is a method that returns \na numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a method returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator gets a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",
            "If any of the simple variables is null, the result of any comparison involving them is null, for example:\n\n```\ncount = null;\nif count + 1 > 0 then\n    callframe newproject;\nendif;\n```\n\nBecause count is null, the result of the comparison that includes count is null. Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon. However, \nthe field function is not allowed in database statements, nor are procedure or method invocations. SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression. Expressions are used in many contexts, \nsuch as specifying values to be retrieved (in a SELECT clause) or compared (in a WHERE clause). For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT empname, empage FROM employee\nWHERE salary > 75000\n```\n\nIn the preceding example, empname and empage are expressions representing the column values to be retrieved, salary \nis an expression representing a column value to be compared, and 75000 is an integer literal expression.\n\nExpressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses, and aggregate functions \ncannot be nested.\n\nAn expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value."

For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In this syntax example, methodname is a method that returns \na numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a method returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object.

For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",

Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon. However, \nthe field function is not allowed in database statements, nor are procedure or method invocations. SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression. Expressions are used in many contexts, \nsuch as specifying values to be retrieved (in a SELECT clause) or compared (in a WHERE clause). For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT empname, empage FROM employee\nWHERE salary > 75000\n```\n\nIn the preceding example, empname and empage are expressions representing the column values to be retrieved, salary \nis an expression representing a column value to be compared, and 75000 is an integer literal expression.\n\nExpressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses, and aggregate functions \ncannot be nested.\n\nAn expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value."

            "# Variables in Expressions\n\nYou can use simple variables alone or in expressions. In the following example, the age variable appears alone on the \nleft side and is an element in the expression \"age + 1\" on the right of the assignment statement:\n\n```\nage = age + 1;\n```\n\nOpenROAD uses the current value of age to compute a new value that replaces the current value.\n\nYou can use the simple variables that are elements of reference or array variables in the same way, for example:\n\n```\ntotal = 0;\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= emptable.LastRow do\n    total = total + emptable[i].salary;\n    i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n\nIn this example, the value in the salary column from the emptable table field is added to the total field as part of \na while loop.\n\n# Procedures in Expressions\n\nWhen a procedure returns a value, such as a return code, it functions as an expression. In the following syntax \nexample, procname is the name of a procedure that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = procname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a procedure as part of an expression, the following rules apply:\n\n- Do not use the callproc keyword.\n- Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.\n- Explicitly name the procedure. You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In this syntax example, methodname is a method that returns \na numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a method returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator gets a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",
            "If any of the simple variables is null, the result of any comparison involving them is null, for example:\n\n```\ncount = null;\nif count + 1 > 0 then\n    callframe newproject;\nendif;\n```\n\nBecause count is null, the result of the comparison that includes count is null. Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon. However, \nthe field function is not allowed in database statements, nor are procedure or method invocations. SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression. Expressions are used in many contexts, \nsuch as specifying values to be retrieved (in a SELECT clause) or compared (in a WHERE clause). For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT empname, empage FROM employee\nWHERE salary > 75000\n```\n\nIn the preceding example, empname and empage are expressions representing the column values to be retrieved, salary \nis an expression representing a column value to be compared, and 75000 is an integer literal expression.\n\nExpressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses, and aggregate functions \ncannot be nested.\n\nAn expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value."

            "# Variables in Expressions\n\nYou can use simple variables alone or in expressions. In the following example, the age variable appears alone on the \nleft side and is an element in the expression \"age + 1\" on the right of the assignment statement:\n\n```\nage = age + 1;\n```\n\nOpenROAD uses the current value of age to compute a new value that replaces the current value.\n\nYou can use the simple variables that are elements of reference or array variables in the same way, for example:\n\n```\ntotal = 0;\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= emptable.LastRow do\n    total = total + emptable[i].salary;\n    i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n\nIn this example, the value in the salary column from the emptable table field is added to the total field as part of \na while loop.\n\n# Procedures in Expressions\n\nWhen a procedure returns a value, such as a return code, it functions as an expression. In the following syntax \nexample, procname is the name of a procedure that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = procname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a procedure as part of an expression, the following rules apply:\n\n- Do not use the callproc keyword.\n- Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.\n- Explicitly name the procedure. You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type.

For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",

Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon. However, \nthe field function is not allowed in database statements, nor are procedure or method invocations. SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression.

For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT empname, empage FROM employee\nWHERE salary > 75000\n```\n\nIn the preceding example, empname and empage are expressions representing the column values to be retrieved, salary \nis an expression representing a column value to be compared, and 75000 is an integer literal expression.\n\nExpressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses, and aggregate functions \ncannot be nested.\n\nAn expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value."

            "# Variables in Expressions\n\nYou can use simple variables alone or in expressions. In the following example, the age variable appears alone on the \nleft side and is an element in the expression \"age + 1\" on the right of the assignment statement:\n\n```\nage = age + 1;\n```\n\nOpenROAD uses the current value of age to compute a new value that replaces the current value.\n\nYou can use the simple variables that are elements of reference or array variables in the same way, for example:\n\n```\ntotal = 0;\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= emptable.LastRow do\n    total = total + emptable[i].salary;\n    i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n\nIn this example, the value in the salary column from the emptable table field is added to the total field as part of \na while loop.\n\n# Procedures in Expressions\n\nWhen a procedure returns a value, such as a return code, it functions as an expression. In the following syntax \nexample, procname is the name of a procedure that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = procname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a procedure as part of an expression, the following rules apply:\n\n- Do not use the callproc keyword.\n- Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.\n- Explicitly name the procedure. You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression. For more information about \nthis statement, see Method Invocation Statement.\n\nWhen a method returns a value, it can function as an expression. In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In this syntax example, methodname is a method that returns \na numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a method returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator gets a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",
            "If any of the simple variables is null, the result of any comparison involving them is null, for example:\n\n```\ncount = null;\nif count + 1 > 0 then\n    callframe newproject;\nendif;\n```\n\nBecause count is null, the result of the comparison that includes count is null. Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon. However, \nthe field function is not allowed in database statements, nor are procedure or method invocations. SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression. Expressions are used in many contexts, \nsuch as specifying values to be retrieved (in a SELECT clause) or compared (in a WHERE clause). For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT empname, empage FROM employee\nWHERE salary > 75000\n```\n\nIn the preceding example, empname and empage are expressions representing the column values to be retrieved, salary \nis an expression representing a column value to be compared, and 75000 is an integer literal expression.\n\nExpressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses, and aggregate functions \ncannot be nested.\n\nAn expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value."

In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In this syntax example, methodname is a method that returns \na numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a method returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator gets a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_meth method returns a variable of \nclass Addr that has an attribute of City, the following expression is legal:\n\n```\nobjectref.Addr_meth().City = 'New York';\n```\n\n# Nulls in Expressions\n\nBecause a null cannot be compared to another value, the only test that you can perform is to see whether it is null \nor not. To perform this test, use the is null or is not null operator in a conditional expression. For more \ninformation, see Is [Not] Null Operator.\n\nIf any item (other than a reference variable) in an expression has a null value, the value of the entire expression \nis null, for example:\n\n```\nmsg = varchar (empno) + ' is not a valid employee number';\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the variable empno has the value null, msg is null after the statement executes.",
            "If any of the simple variables is null, the result of any comparison involving them is null, for example:\n\n```\ncount = null;\nif count + 1 > 0 then\n    callframe newproject;\nendif;\n```\n\nBecause count is null, the result of the comparison that includes count is null. Therefore, the callframe statement \nis never executed.\n\nThis rule holds true for more complicated expressions, as in the following statements:\n\n```\nman_days = varchar(days) + 'days';\nif (start_date + man_days) > 'today' then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nIf start_date or man_days is null, the entire boolean expression evaluates to null and the processing statements are \nnever performed.\n\n# Expressions in SQL Statements\n\nWhen using expressions in SQL statements in OpenROAD, the operands of the functions and operators (or the entire \nexpression) may be literals or database column names. In contexts where correlation names are defined (for example, \nwith the select statement), a column name may be preceded by a correlation name (separated from the column name by a \nperiod).\n\nYou can replace any literal with a named constant or simple variable name (or a reference to a simple variable that \nis an attribute of a reference variable or an attribute of a row of an array variable) preceded by a colon. However, \nthe field function is not allowed in database statements, nor are procedure or method invocations. SQL function and \noperators are allowed (they are evaluated by the database).\n\nExpressions are composed of various operators and operands that evaluate to a single value or a set of values. Some \nexpressions do not use operators; for example, a column name is an expression. Expressions are used in many contexts, \nsuch as specifying values to be retrieved (in a SELECT clause) or compared (in a WHERE clause). For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT empname, empage FROM employee\nWHERE salary > 75000\n```\n\nIn the preceding example, empname and empage are expressions representing the column values to be retrieved, salary \nis an expression representing a column value to be compared, and 75000 is an integer literal expression.\n\nExpressions that contain aggregate functions can appear only in SELECT and HAVING clauses, and aggregate functions \ncannot be nested.\n\nAn expression can be enclosed in parentheses without affecting its value."

            "# Variables in Expressions\n\nYou can use simple variables alone or in expressions. In the following example, the age variable appears alone on the \nleft side and is an element in the expression \"age + 1\" on the right of the assignment statement:\n\n```\nage = age + 1;\n```\n\nOpenROAD uses the current value of age to compute a new value that replaces the current value.\n\nYou can use the simple variables that are elements of reference or array variables in the same way, for example:\n\n```\ntotal = 0;\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= emptable.LastRow do\n    total = total + emptable[i].salary;\n    i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n\nIn this example, the value in the salary column from the emptable table field is added to the total field as part of \na while loop.\n\n# Procedures in Expressions\n\nWhen a procedure returns a value, such as a return code, it functions as an expression. In the following syntax \nexample, procname is the name of a procedure that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = procname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a procedure as part of an expression, the following rules apply:\n\n- Do not use the callproc keyword.\n- Include the parentheses even if you are not passing any parameters to the procedure.\n- Explicitly name the procedure. You can use a variable for the name of a procedure if you assign it to a variable. \n  For example, the following assignment is legal:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc();\n  ```\n  However you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the procedure name. For example, the \n  following expression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n  ```\n  a = :varproc() + 7;\n  ```\n\nBecause procedures can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type. In the syntax example just described, procname is a \nprocedure that returns a numeric type like integer or float, allowing you to use the return value in the addition.\n\nIf a procedure returns an object, the return value can be manipulated like any other object. That is, you can use the \ndot operator (.) to access individual attributes, or you can apply a method to that object.\n\nUsing the dot operator produces a variable of some kind (depending on the type of the attribute), so you can use the \nresulting variable wherever other variables can be used. For example, if the addr_proc procedure returns a variable \nof class Addr that has an attribute \"City,\" the following expression is legal:\n\n```\naddr_proc().City = 'New York';\n```\n\nBecause you can apply methods to the return value, and because methods can return values of any type, referencing can \nbe nested on a procedure's return value, for example:\n\n```\nret_framexec().ObjectSource.Duplicate().name\n```\n\n# Methods in Expressions\n\nThe 4GL statement, method invocation, lets you invoke a method as part of an expression.

In the following syntax example, methodname is the \nname of a method that returns a value:\n\n```\nreturnval = objectref.methodname() + 1;\n```\n\nWhen you call a method as part of an expression, you must explicitly name the method. You can use a variable for the \nname of a method if you assign the name to a varchar variable. For example, the following assignment is legal:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth();\n```\n\nHowever you cannot use operators when you are assigning a variable as the method name. For example, the following \nexpression is illegal and cannot be specified at runtime:\n\n```\na = objectref.:varmeth() + 7;\n```\n\nBecause methods can return a value of any type, such as an object or an array, you can operate on the return value \nwith any operation appropriate to the return value type.
