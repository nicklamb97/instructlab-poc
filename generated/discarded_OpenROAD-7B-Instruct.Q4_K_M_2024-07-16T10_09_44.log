For example:\nTask: Describe how to initialize a variable in an Actian 4GL program using the 'OPEN' statement.\nInput\n<noinput>\nOutput\nTo open an existing file or database and initialize its variables in your Actian 4GL program, use the `OPEN`\nstatement as follows:\n```\nOPEN 'filename';\n```\nReplace `filename` with the actual name of the file or database you want to open. The `OPEN` statement can also be used\nwith a path specification for files on the local disk. For example, the following opens a text file in the current\ndirectory:\n```\nOPEN 'C:\\my_documents\\my_diary.txt';\n```\nWhen opening a database, Ingres establishes a connection to it and initializes all of its variables. The `OPEN`\nstatement can also be used with a host name and port number for remote databases. For example, the following opens a database\non the server 'my_database.com' at port 3060:\n```\nOPEN HOST 'my_database.com' PORT 3060;\n```\nWhen using the `OPEN` statement with a path specification for files on the local disk, Ingres checks that the file\nexists and has read access permissions before opening it. If the file does not exist or you do not have read access,\nIngres displays an error message and does not open the file. When opening a database over a network, Ingres verifies\nthat the host is reachable and has a valid Open Database Connection (ODBC) driver installed before establishing the\nconnection. If the host cannot be reached or no valid ODBC driver exists, Ingres displays an error message and does not establish the connection.\n"

These statements enable you to copy large amounts of data between different systems or within the same database quickly and efficiently. For example, you might use a single COPY statement to import all records from an employee table into a new file called 'staff_list'. Or you could export the orders table to an external text file with just one line of code:\n```sql\nCOPY orders TO 'order_data';\n```\nThese statements demonstrate the simplicity and versatility of Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements in handling data transfers between different systems or within the same database.\n"

Instead, use any other character that is not used as part of your field names or values.\nFor example, when copying the 'C0' format into a text file, any control characters or tabs in the input are converted to spaces. Similarly, when reading data from an external text file, any control characters or tabs are also converted to spaces before being stored in memory.\n* When specifying delimiters for variable-length strings, use the 5-character right-justified length specifier. For example:\n```sql\nCOPY staff_list (\n    first_name CHAR(20), last_name CHAR(30), title CHAR(10));\n```\nIn this example, the 'CHAR' keyword specifies that the field should be treated as a fixed-length string of the specified length. The length specifier follows it, which is 20 characters for 'first_name', 30 characters for 'last_name', and 10 characters for 'title'. When copying data into or out of the file, any control characters or tabs are converted to spaces before being stored in memory.\n* When specifying delimiters for fixed-length strings, use the 5-character left-justified length specifier. For example:\n```sql\nCOPY customers (\n    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\n    company_name CHAR(40) NOT NULL);\n```\nIn this example, the 'CHAR' keyword specifies that the field should be treated as a fixed-length string of the specified length. The length specifier follows it, which is 40 characters for 'company_name'. When copying data into or out of the file, any control characters or tabs are padded with zeros before being stored in memory.\n* When using Actian 4GL with other systems or databases, it is important to understand how they handle delimiters and field names. For example:\n```sql\nCOPY orders TO 'order_data';\n```\nIn this example, the 'ORDER BY' clause specifies the order in which the records should be sorted when copied into the external text file. The field names are also specified after the keyword 'ORDER'. When copying data into or out of the file, any control characters or tabs are converted to spaces before being stored in memory.\n* Actian 4GL supports a wide range of data types, including numeric and character types. When working with these types, it is important to understand how they are represented in memory and when transferring between systems or databases. For example:\n```sql\nCOPY employees (\n    employee_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\n    first_name CHAR(20), last_name CHAR(30), title CHAR(10));\n```\nIn this example, the 'INTEGER' keyword specifies that the field should be treated as a numeric value. The length specifier follows it, which is 20 characters for 'first_name', 30 characters for 'last_name', and 10 characters for 'title'. When copying data into or out of the file, any control characters or tabs are converted to spaces before being stored in memory.\n* Actian 4GL also supports binary and boolean types. When working with these types, it is important to understand how they are represented in memory and when transferring between systems or databases. For example:\n```sql\nCOPY addresses (\n    address_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\n    street_address CHAR(70), city CHAR(30), state CHAR(2));\n```\nIn this example, the 'BOOLEAN' keyword specifies that the field should be treated as a boolean value. The length specifier follows it, which is 70 characters for 'street_address', 30 characters for 'city', and 2 characters for 'state'. When copying data into or out of the file, any control characters or tabs are padded with zeros before being stored in memory.\n* When using Actian 4GL with other systems or databases, it is important to understand how they handle delimiters and field names. For example:\n```sql\nCOPY customers TO 'customer_data';\n```\nIn this example, the 'TO' clause specifies the destination of the copy operation. The field names are also specified after the keyword 'CUSTOMER'. When copying data into or out of the file, any control characters or tabs are converted to spaces before being stored in memory.\n* Actian 4GL supports a wide range of data types, including numeric and character types. When working with these types, it is important to understand how they are represented in memory and when transferring between systems or databases. For example:\n```sql\nCOPY orders (\n    order_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\n    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\n    product_code CHAR(10), quantity INTEGER NOT NULL, price DECIMAL(6,2));\n```\nIn this example, the 'DECIMAL' keyword specifies that the field should be treated as a decimal value. The length specifier follows it, which is 10 characters for 'product_code', and 6 digits after the decimal point for 'price'. When copying data into or out of the file, any control characters or tabs are padded with zeros before being stored in memory.\nTask 5\n** Instruction\nDescribe how to use Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements to import and export data from/to external files.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nHere is an example of using Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements to import and export data from/to external files:\n```sql\n-- Import all records from the 'employees' table into a new file called 'staff_list'.\nCOPY staff_list (\n    first_name, last_name, title)\nFROM employees;\n\n-- Export the 'orders' table to an external text file.\nCOPY orders TO 'order_data';\n```\nIn this example, the first statement imports all records from the 'employees' table into a new file called 'staff_list'. The second statement exports all records in the 'orders' table to an external text file named 'order_data'. When copying data into or out of the file, any control characters or tabs are converted to spaces before being stored in memory.\n"

Because bulk copy cannot start until it gets an exclusive lock, this operation can be delayed due to lock contention.\n•When performing a non-bulk copy into a table, the DBMS server takes an “intent exclusive” lock on the table, and uses insert to update the table. As a result, the operation can be aborted due to deadlock.\nRestrictions and Considerations\nCopy cannot be used to add data to a view, index, or system catalog.\nWhen copying data into a table, copy ignores any integrity constraints defined (using the create integrity statement (see Create Integrity Statement)) against the table.\nThe copy statement does not fire any rules defined against the table.\nValues cannot be assigned to SYSTEM_MAINTAINED logical key columns. The DBMS Server assigns values when copying from a data file to a table.\nCopy treats a present-but-empty field in the data file as:\n•A blank default for character-based columns\n•A zero default for numeric columns\n•December 31 00-1 for date and timestamp columns\n•00:00:00 for time columns (and the time component in a timestamp)\nFor example, if you load a data file (copy from) that contains a record with one empty value into a table with a mandatory (not default) integer field, the load of the one record does not fail due to the missing value, but succeeds and loads a 0. You get the error for the missing value if the column is omitted from the copy list.

To omit the city column, a dummy column is employed. The format of the employee table is as follows:\nname     char(15)\nage       integer4\ndept      char(10)\ncomment   varchar(20)\nThe emp.txt file contains the following data:\nJones,J. 32 Anytown,USA toy,00017A This is a comment\nSmith,P. 41 New York,NY admin,00015 Another comment\nThe following diagram illustrates the copy statement that copies the file, emp.txt, into the employee table, and maps the fields in the file to the portions of the statement that specify how the field is to be copied. Note the following points:\n•A dummy column is used to skip the city and state field in the data file, because there is no matching column in the employee table.\n•The department field is delimited by a comma.\n•The comment field is a variable-length varchar field, preceded by a five-character length specifier.\n'
2024-07-16T12:34:17 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nInstructions: Describe how you can use the 'WITH CLause' option with the 'COPY STATEMENT'.\nInput: With Clause for Copy\nValid with clause options for the copy statement are as follows:\nOn_error=TERMINATE|CONTINUE\non_error = TERMINATE | CONTINUE\nDirects copy to continue after encountering conversion errors.\nTo direct copy to continue until a specified number of conversion errors have occurred, specify the error_count option instead.\nBy default, copy terminates when an error occurs while converting between table format and file format\nWhen on_error is set to CONTINUE, copy displays a warning whenever a conversion error occurs, skips the row that caused the error, and continues processing the remaining rows. At the end of the processing, copy displays a message that indicates how many warnings were issued and how many rows were successfully copied.\nSetting on_error to CONTINUE does not affect how copy responds to errors other than conversion errors. Any other error, such as an error writing the file, terminates the copy operation.\nError_count=n\nerror_count = n\nSpecifies how many errors can occur before processing terminates.\nDefault: 1.\nIf on_error is set to continue, setting error_count has no effect.\nLog='filename'\nlog = 'filename'\nStores to a file any rows that copy cannot process. This option can be used only if on_error CONTINUE is specified. When specified with log, copy places any rows that it cannot process into the specified log file. For copy into, the logged rows are in database (binary) format; for copy from, the logged rows are in file format.\nLogging works as follows:\nWindows: Copy opens the log file prior to the start of data transfer. If it cannot open the log file, copy halts. If an error occurs when writing to the log file, copy issues a warning, but continues. If the specified log file already exists, it is overwritten with the new values (or truncated if the copy operation encounters no bad rows).\nUNIX: Copy opens the log file prior to the start of data transfer. If it cannot open the log file, copy halts. If an error occurs when writing to the log file, copy issues a warning, but continues. If the specified log file already exists, it is overwritten with the new values (or truncated if the copy operation encounters no bad rows).\nThe log option is not available if the table contains any long columns, whether they are part of the copy list or not.\nIf copying from a data file that contains duplicate rows (or rows that duplicate keys already in the table) to a table that was created with noduplicates and has a HASH, ISAM or BTREE storage structure, copy displays a warning message and does not add the duplicate rows. If the with log option is specified, copy does not write the duplicate rows to the log file.\nRollback=ENABLED|DISABLED\nrollback = ENABLED | DISABLED\nEnables or disables rollback, as follows:\nENABLED\nDirects the DBMS Server to back out all rows appended by the copy if the copy is terminated due to an error.\nDISABLED\nRetains the appended rows.\nThe rollback=DISABLED option does not mean that the copy cannot be rolled back. Database server errors that indicate data corruption will always roll back the copy statement. In addition, the user may decide to rollback the entire transaction rather than committing it with a commit.\nDefault: ENABLED\nWhen copying to a file, the with rollback clause has no effect.\nRow_estimate\nrow_estimate\nSpecifies the estimated number of rows to be copied from a file to a table during a bulk copy operation. The DBMS Server uses the specified value to allocate memory for sorting rows before inserting them into the table. An accurate estimate can enhance the performance of the copy operation.\nThe estimated number of rows must be no less than 0 and no greater than 2,147,483,647. If this parameter is omitted, the default value is 0, in which case the DBMS Server makes its own estimates for disk and memory requirements.\nPermissions\nTo use the copy statement, one of the following must apply:\n•You own the table.\n•The table has select (for copy into) or insert (for copy from) privilege granted to PUBLIC.\n•You have been granted COPY_INTO (for copy into) or COPY_FROM (for copy from) privileges on the table.\nLocking\n•When copying from a table into a file, the DBMS Server takes a shared lock on the table.\n"

This format is particularly useful when designing custom formats for importing and exporting complex data types, such as:\n• Objects with multiple attributes (e.g., customers),\n• Enumerated types (e.g., gender or color), or\n• Numeric values that require specific precision (e.g., money).\nFor example, in the following code snippet:\n```\ncreate table employee (\n  name char(20) not null,\n  title enum('Manager', 'Supervisor', 'Employee') unique,\n  salary numeric(8,2) primary key;\n```\nHere, we define the 'name' column as a fixed-length string with no allowance for null values. The other fields in this example are also defined using their appropriate formats:\n• ‘title’ is an enumerated type with unique values representing different job titles, and\n• ‘salary’ is a numeric field representing the employee’s annual salary, set as the primary key for this table.\nYou can then use these fields in your code, such as setting values, performing calculations, or displaying them on forms or reports. The 'C0CSV' format is used here to separate the columns and mark the end of records in the data file.\n"
