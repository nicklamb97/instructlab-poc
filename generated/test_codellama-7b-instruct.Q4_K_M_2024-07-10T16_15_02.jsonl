It allows the use of any legal 4GL statements separated by semicolons."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What does 'statement' represent in the Statement List syntax?", "assistant": "'statement' represents any valid 4GL statement, with some exceptions. It allows for multiple statements to be grouped together."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How are multiple statements separated in a Statement List?", "assistant": "Multiple statements in a Statement List are separated by semicolons."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can you nest Statement Lists within each other?", "assistant": "The syntax doesn't explicitly forbid nesting, but it's important to note that certain statements (Initialize, Method, On, Procedure) are not allowed within a Statement List."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the purpose of using a Statement List in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?", "assistant": "A Statement List allows developers to group multiple 4GL statements together, which can be useful for organizing code, creating code blocks, or defining a series of actions to be executed together."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How does a Statement List differ from a regular sequence of statements in a program?", "assistant": "A Statement List is specifically defined as a syntactic element in OpenROAD Actian 4GL, while a regular sequence of statements is just a part of the normal flow of a program. The Statement List has specific rules about what can be included."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Is there a limit to the number of statements that can be included in a Statement List?", "assistant": "The syntax doesn't specify a limit to the number of statements. You can include multiple statements, each separated by a semicolon."}
