The loop will continue as long as the control variable is less than or equal to the end value specified by the user.\n\nA while loop in Actian 4GL is used to repeat a statement repeatedly based on some condition. The condition is evaluated at each iteration and if it evaluates to true, the loop continues until the condition becomes false.\n\nSo, FOR loop iterates over a range of values, and while loop repeats a statement repeatedly based on a condition."}
