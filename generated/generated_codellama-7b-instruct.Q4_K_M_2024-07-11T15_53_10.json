Better performance by optimizing memory allocation for local variables rather than relying on system-level memory management.\n5.

It should appear inside any procedure or function before the 'begin' statement, for example:\nprocedure MyProcedure\nLocalVariableDeclaration\ninteger var1;\ndate var2 = date(year: 2015 month: 8 day: 30);\nvar1 = 0;\nvar2 = date(year: 2015 month: 8 day: 31);\nbegin\nwrite line 'MyProcedure:', var1, var2;\nend;\nIn this example, 'LocalVariableDeclaration' is used to declare two local variables 'var1' and 'var2'. Note that the variables are not visible outside of the procedure or function. You cannot access them from the calling code. This declaration makes it possible for you to break your Actian 4GL program into smaller, more manageable procedures or functions instead of writing all of your code in one block.\n* Declare: On the other hand, 'Declare' is a standalone statement that can be used outside of any procedure or function body and will make its variables visible across your entire codebase. For example:\nDeclare integer var1;\nDeclare date var2 = date(year: 2015 month: 8 day: 30);\nvar1 = 0;\nwrite line 'MyProcedure:', var1, var2;\nHere 'Declare' statement is used to declare two global variables 'var1' and 'var2'.
