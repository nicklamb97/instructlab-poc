For example, the following statement declares an instance variable of type IntegerObject with a null value:\n\nIntegerObject i;\n\nHowever, the next statement causes client-side coercion because the string \"2\" cannot be converted to a valid integer without truncation:\n\ni = \"2\";\n\nTo avoid client-side coercion, use the `not null` clause for any class data type that can have a value of null. For example, use this statement instead:\n\nIntegerObject i(null);\n*"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the default data type for a variable when no explicit data type declaration is provided?", "assistant": "In OpenROAD, the default data type of a variable depends on whether it is declared as reference or class. If there is no explicit data type declaration for a variable that is declared as a class, then OpenROAD assumes a data type of char/character. The reason for this is because the longest length that can be stored in a field with a default data type of char/character is 4095 characters (same as long varchar)."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the difference between a character type and a numeric type?", "assistant": "A character type is used to store alphabetic characters and other non-numeric symbols, whereas a numeric type stores numerical values. The main difference between the two data types is the way they handle and manipulate values. Character types are ideal for text-based applications while numeric types are suitable for calculations."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How do you declare a data type non-nullable in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "You can use the `not null` clause to declare a data type non-nullable. For example, you might have an integer variable called `age` that is declared as:  `integer age not null`. The keyword `not null` indicates that this value cannot be set to NULL when the record is created or updated."}

A reference variable does not store an actual object but rather a pointer to an object. When you use a reference variable, you cannot create the object it references until the `new` keyword is used with the object name. For example: `dim a as ref b; new b;`"}

The server-side coercion should be enabled for this data type if you want to use it."}

MoneyObject\nNote: The scalars objects are built-in OpenROAD classes, so it is not necessary to import them into your application program.

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the difference between a scalar data type and a reference data type?", "assistant": "The primary difference between a scalar data type (integer, decimal, float etc) and a reference data type is that a scalar variable can be assigned an initial value and stored in memory. A reference variable holds an address to the actual object and not its value. Scalar variables are used when you need the data in a local scope or when you do not need any changes made to it to affect other parts of your code. Reference variables are used when you need to manipulate objects."}

It can be used when you have a variable that holds a data type that cannot be used in a particular context but you would like to present it differently. For example, when you print an integer on the screen, you may want to convert it to a string with thousands separator so that it is easier to read by humans."}
