See also Boolean Operators.\n- `Object` and `Reference`: Declares a local variable that stores an object reference or a value of any type\n  other than Integer, Double, String, Date or DateTime, which are already built-in types in ACT! and can be\n  used directly as variables without the need to declare them. For example, if you have an object called MyObject, then you can refer to it using a local variable named MyObject that has the type Object.
