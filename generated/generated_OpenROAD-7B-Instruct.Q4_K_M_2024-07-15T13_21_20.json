Or does it not finish at all?\n2) Narrow down potential causes by examining similar cases and reviewing related documentation (e.g., error messages or logs).\n3) Perform a detailed analysis using debugging tools such as breakpoints, watches, or the console. This will help you identify the exact line of code causing the problem and any relevant variables or parameters involved.\n4) Implement temporary fixes while you work on a permanent solution, if necessary. For example, you can use conditional statements to bypass problematic sections of your code until you have fixed them.\n5) Test your changes thoroughly before committing them to production, so that you do not introduce new bugs into your system.",
