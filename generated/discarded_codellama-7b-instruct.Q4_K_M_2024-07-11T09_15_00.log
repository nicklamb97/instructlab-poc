Here are my suggestions:\nTask 4\nInstruction\nWhat is a local procedure? What does it do? What are its benefits?\nInput\n<noinput>\nOutput\nA local procedure is a subroutine or function defined within an OpenROAD Actian 4GL program. It allows for reusable code that can be called by other parts of the program or even by other programs. Local procedures help with code organization and reuse, making it easier to maintain and update the program.\nTask 5\nInstruction\nWhat is OpenROAD Actian 4GL? What does it offer? Can you provide an example use case?\nInput\n<noinput>\nOutput\nOpenROAD Actian 4GL is a programming language that allows developers to create applications for various database systems. It provides an intuitive and efficient way to design, develop, and test applications using the ACTIAN database system. OpenROAD Actian 4GL offers a variety of features, including type without default, to help with code organization and reuse, making it easier to maintain and update applications. Here's an example use case: consider a banking application that requires processing multiple loan requests from different branches. If the application used OpenROAD Actian 4GL, developers could write separate local procedures for each loan type (e.g. residential mortgage, commercial lease), making it easier to maintain and update the program without affecting other branches.\n"

2024-07-11T11:36:40 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nYes, we can create a class for variables and parameters using Type Without Default. The following code snippet shows how to do this in OpenROAD Actian 4GL:\n```\nClass_Type("Integer");\nClass_Nullable();\nClass_Length(10);\n\nDefineVariable("myVariable", "My_New_Class");\nDefineParameter("myParameter", "My_New_Class");\n```\nIn this code, the Class_Type() method sets the type of the variable or parameter to class My_New_Class. The Class_Nullable() method specifies that null values are allowed for the variable or parameter, and the Class_Length() method specifies the length of the string or binary data (for the variable) or the maximum number of elements in a collection (for the parameter).\n\nHere is an example of using Type Without Default to define a parameter:\n```\nDefineParameter("myParameter", "My_New_Class");\n```\nNote that you must use the DefineParameter method instead of the DefineVariable method when you want to create a new class for the parameter. In the preceding code, "My_New_Class" is the name of your new class. When you are finished using Type Without Default, you can remove the class from your program by using the Class_Remove() method, as follows:\n```\nClass_Type("Integer");\nClass_Nullable();\nClass_Length(10);\n\nDefineVariable("myVariable", "My_New_Class");\nClass_Remove("My_New_Class");\n```\nNote that you do not need to include the Class_Nullable() method when removing the class if null values are allowed for the variable. If null values are not allowed for the variable, use the Class_Length() method to specify the length of the string or binary data (for the variable). The following code specifies that no null values are allowed for the variable myVariable and sets its length to 10:\n```\nClass_Type("Integer");\nDefineVariable("myVariable", "My_New_Class");\nClass_Length(10);\n\n```\nNote that you do not need to include the Class_Nullable() method when removing the class if null values are allowed for the variable. If null values are not allowed for the variable, use the Class_Length() method to specify the length of the string or binary data (for the variable). The following code specifies that no null values are allowed for the variable myVariable and sets its length to 10:\n```\nClass_Type("Integer");\nDefineVariable("myVariable", "My_New_Class");\nClass_Length(10);\n\nClass_Remove("My_New_Class");\n```'

Here is an example:\n\nExample1:\n```\ndeclare local variable @dtype;\nset @dtype = "numeric";\n```\nHere, the numeric data type is used as the type without default. The programmer must explicitly specify the nullability of the variable by using the "null" or "not null" keywords.
