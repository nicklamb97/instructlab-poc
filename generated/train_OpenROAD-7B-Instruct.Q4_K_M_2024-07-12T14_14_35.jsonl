However, if one of those fields is an integer type, such as INT or SMALLINT, then you can only store 2^32 distinct values for that field. This limits the overall capacity of the table.\nIn general, you should design your tables to accommodate the expected volume of data. If you expect to have millions of records, then you might want to consider using larger tables or partitioning them into multiple smaller tables. This can help manage the size and complexity of your data while still allowing for efficient storage and retrieval."}

For example:\n```4gl\nSQRT(16).DISPLAY;\n```\nThis code calculates the square root of 16 and displays it on the screen. The SQRT function returns a double precision floating point number, so you can use it with any type of numeric data, including integers, floats, or even strings."}

This statement has two clauses: the first one specifies which columns to select and the second one specifies how many rows to return. For example:\n```4gl\nSELECT ORDER_NUMBER, CUSTOMER_NAME FROM ORDERS INTO ARRAY(10);\n```\nThis code selects the order number column and customer name column from the 'ORDERS' table into an array with a capacity of 10. Actian 4GL will then execute this statement in your code, retrieving the specified columns from the specified table and storing their values into the array you declared. You can then access the properties and methods of this array using the FIELD() function."}

Here's an example of how to create a function that calculates the sum of its integer arguments:\n```4gl\nFUNCTION ADD_NUMBERS(a INTEGER)\n    FIELD a = NULL;\n    FOR i IN 1 TO a.SIZE\n        FIELD i = a[i];\n    SUM(fi) = 0;\n    WHILE (fi > 0)\n        SUM(fi) += fi;\n    RETURN SUM(fi);\nEND FUNCTION\n```\nThis code defines an 'ADD_NUMBERS' function that takes a single integer argument and stores it in the 'a' field. Then, it loops through all the elements of the array using the 'FOR' clause. Inside the loop, it accesses each element 'i' and adds its value to the 'SUM(fi)' variable. Finally, when the loop terminates, the function returns the final sum in the 'SUM(fi)' variable. You can then call this function from your code by specifying its name followed by an integer argument enclosed in parentheses:\n```4gl\nCALL ADD_NUMBERS(10);\n```\nThis code calls the 'ADD_NUMBERS' function with a single integer argument of 10. Actian 4GL will then execute this statement, storing the value of 10 into the 'a' field of the function. The function will then loop through all its elements and add them up, returning the final sum in the 'SUM(fi)' variable."}

Now when you run this statement in your code, Actian 4GL will no longer display it on top of all other open tabs and allow you to work with it as normal. The REMOVE statement is similar to TAB, but instead of closing another type of window, it removes an entry from an existing menu or opens another type of window—a menu.

Here's an example of how to create a simple class called 'Person' that has two fields ('name' and 'age') and one method ('speak()'):\n```4gl\nCLASS Person\n{\n    FIELD name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE;\n    FIELD age INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 18;\n    METHOD speak()\n        FIELD this = PERSON(name).ASSERT('not null');\n        THIS.name = 'John';\n        THIS.age = 35;\n        WRITE($\"Hello, my name is {this.name} and I am {this.age} years old.\");\n    END METHOD\n};\n```\nThis code defines a 'CLASS' called 'Person' with two fields ('name' and 'age'). The 'name' field is declared as a non-nullable text type, while the 'age' field is defined as an integer not nullable. Inside the class, you can see the declaration of a single method called 'speak()'. This method takes no arguments but performs some actions on itself, such as setting its own name and age attributes to specific values. Finally, when the method terminates, it writes out a message to the console that contains information about itself (its name and age). You can then create instances of this class from your code by specifying its name followed by an integer argument enclosed in parentheses:\n```4gl\nCALL NEW(Person);\n```\nThis code calls the 'NEW' function with a single integer argument of 0. Actian 4GL will then create a new instance of the 'Person' class and initialize its fields with the default values specified in the class definition. The 'NEW' function also returns a reference to the newly created object, which you can then access from your code by referring to it with the '@' symbol:\n```4gl\nMY_PERSON = NEW(Person);\n```\nThis statement creates a new instance of the 'Person' class and stores its reference into the 'my_person' variable. You can now use this variable in your code, such as performing calculations on it or comparing it to other values."}
