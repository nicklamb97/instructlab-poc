The dollar sign is optional and the algebraic sign(s) defaults to + if not specified.\n\nTask 2\n** Instruction\nHow many decimal places are displayed by default for money data in OpenROAD?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nBy default, two decimal places are displayed for money data in OpenROAD.\n\nTask 3\n** Instruction\nWhat is the range of values that a money variable can accommodate in OpenROAD?\n** Input\n<nooutput>\n** Output\nA money variable in OpenROAD can accommodate the following range of values:\n-$999,999,999,999.99 to $999,999,999,999.99\n\nTask 4\n** Instruction\nHow many decimal places are displayed by default for money data output in OpenROAD?\n** Input\n<nooutput>\n** Output\nBy default, two decimal places are displayed for money data output in OpenROAD.'
2024-07-08T13:04:09 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nInstruction:\nHow is a money value specified as a character string literal in OpenROAD?\nOutput:\nA money value can be specified as a character string literal in OpenROAD by using the format $sdddddddddddd.dd. The dollar sign is optional and the algebraic sign(s) defaults to + if not specified. There is no need to specify a cents value of zero (.00).\nExample:\n$123456789.01\n'

The display format is: $[-]dddddddddddd.dd. where $ is the default currency symbol and d is a digit from 0 to 9.\nExample:\n$1234567890.12 (displayed as $12,345,678.90)\n'
2024-07-08T13:39:28 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nInstructions: Explain how to convert a numerical string value to its equivalent floating-point number representation.\n\nExample: Convert the string '123456789' to its floating-point equivalent 1234567890.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string.\n2. Check if the input string contains only digits. If not, then the input cannot be converted to a numerical value.\n3. Convert the remaining characters in the string to their integer equivalents using the ASCII character codes for digits.\n4. Perform any necessary floating-point arithmetic conversions based on the position of the decimal point in the string. For example, if the decimal point is at position n, then convert the first n-1 digits to their integer equivalents and divide them by 10^n to get the integer part of the floating-point number. Then, convert the last (n+1) digits to their integer equivalents and divide them by 10^(-n) to get the fractional part of the floating-point number.\n5. Combine the integer and fractional parts to get the final floating-point equivalent of the numerical string value.\n\nNote that the example given in this section does not include any error handling or exception handling, so it is important to ensure that the input string is valid before attempting to convert it to a floating-point number."
2024-07-08T14:10:49 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nDescribe the logical key data type in OpenROAD.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe logical key data type in OpenROAD allows the DBMS Server or your application to assign a unique key value to each row in a table when an application requires a table to have a unique key and the columns of the table do not comprise a unique key. There are two types of logical keys: SYSTEM_MAINTAINED and NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED. Specify the scope of uniqueness for system maintained logical key columns using the following options: TABLE_KEY or OBJECT_KEY. Values assigned to TABLE_KEYs must be 8-byte strings; values assigned to OBJECT_KEYs must be 16-byte strings. In a UTF-8 environment, logical keys must be passed as type BYTE.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhen working with logical keys in OpenROAD, be aware of the following restrictions: a system_maintained logical key column cannot be created using the CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT statement and the COPY statement cannot be used to load values from a file into a system_maintained column.'
