            "# Reference Variables\n\nA reference variable is a variable that points to an object of a given class, letting you access the value of an \nobject. An object is a compound data structure that holds values that you can manipulate. A reference variable does \nnot store its own values. Instead, when you reference the reference variable, OpenROAD uses the values in the \ncorresponding object. The object is made up of attributes, which can be simple variables, reference variables, or \narray variables.\n\nThe class of an object defines its attributes. OpenROAD includes both system classes and user-defined classes.\n\nIn your 4GL code, when you reference a reference variable, you can work with the entire object as a single unit. For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method.

            "# Reference Variables\n\nA reference variable is a variable that points to an object of a given class, letting you access the value of an \nobject. An object is a compound data structure that holds values that you can manipulate. A reference variable does \nnot store its own values. Instead, when you reference the reference variable, OpenROAD uses the values in the \ncorresponding object. The object is made up of attributes, which can be simple variables, reference variables, or \narray variables.\n\nThe class of an object defines its attributes. OpenROAD includes both system classes and user-defined classes.\n\nIn your 4GL code, when you reference a reference variable, you can work with the entire object as a single unit. For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method.

            "# Simple Variables\n\nA simple variable is a single data item. It contains only one value. A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable. If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause. The default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the \n*Language Reference Guide* online help, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default false;\n```\n\nThe with null, not default, and with default (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic compatibility with \nSQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.\n\n## How You Can Use Simple Variables\n\nTo make use of a simple variable, use the variable name. For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable. In the second, \nmovies[].Title is a simple variable that is an element of an array.\n\nFor information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable, see Reference Variables \nand Dynamic Array Variables."

            "# Reference Variables\n\nA reference variable is a variable that points to an object of a given class, letting you access the value of an \nobject. An object is a compound data structure that holds values that you can manipulate. A reference variable does \nnot store its own values. Instead, when you reference the reference variable, OpenROAD uses the values in the \ncorresponding object. The object is made up of attributes, which can be simple variables, reference variables, or \narray variables.\n\nThe class of an object defines its attributes. OpenROAD includes both system classes and user-defined classes.\n\nIn your 4GL code, when you reference a reference variable, you can work with the entire object as a single unit. For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",

An object is a compound data structure that holds values that you can manipulate. A reference variable does \nnot store its own values. Instead, when you reference the reference variable, OpenROAD uses the values in the \ncorresponding object. The object is made up of attributes, which can be simple variables, reference variables, or \narray variables.\n\nThe class of an object defines its attributes. OpenROAD includes both system classes and user-defined classes.\n\nIn your 4GL code, when you reference a reference variable, you can work with the entire object as a single unit. For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object.

For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method.

If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method. Examples of using the Create method \nare provided in \"Creating a Frame at Runtime\" in the Programming Guide."

            "# Simple Variables\n\nA simple variable is a single data item. It contains only one value. A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable. If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause. The default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the \n*Language Reference Guide* online help, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default false;\n```\n\nThe with null, not default, and with default (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic compatibility with \nSQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.\n\n## How You Can Use Simple Variables\n\nTo make use of a simple variable, use the variable name. For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable. In the second, \nmovies[].Title is a simple variable that is an element of an array.\n\nFor information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable, see Reference Variables \nand Dynamic Array Variables."

            "# Reference Variables\n\nA reference variable is a variable that points to an object of a given class, letting you access the value of an \nobject. An object is a compound data structure that holds values that you can manipulate. A reference variable does \nnot store its own values. Instead, when you reference the reference variable, OpenROAD uses the values in the \ncorresponding object. The object is made up of attributes, which can be simple variables, reference variables, or \narray variables.\n\nThe class of an object defines its attributes. OpenROAD includes both system classes and user-defined classes.\n\nIn your 4GL code, when you reference a reference variable, you can work with the entire object as a single unit. For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method.

You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method. Examples of using the Create method \nare provided in \"Creating a Frame at Runtime\" in the Programming Guide."

A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable. If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause. The default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the \n*Language Reference Guide* online help, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default false;\n```\n\nThe with null, not default, and with default (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic compatibility with \nSQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.\n\n## How You Can Use Simple Variables\n\nTo make use of a simple variable, use the variable name. For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable. In the second, \nmovies[].Title is a simple variable that is an element of an array.\n\nFor information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable, see Reference Variables \nand Dynamic Array Variables."

For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method.

            "# Simple Variables\n\nA simple variable is a single data item. It contains only one value. A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable. If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause. The default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the \n*Language Reference Guide* online help, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default false;\n```\n\nThe with null, not default, and with default (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic compatibility with \nSQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.\n\n## How You Can Use Simple Variables\n\nTo make use of a simple variable, use the variable name. For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable. In the second, \nmovies[].Title is a simple variable that is an element of an array.\n\nFor information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable, see Reference Variables \nand Dynamic Array Variables."

            "# Reference Variables\n\nA reference variable is a variable that points to an object of a given class, letting you access the value of an \nobject. An object is a compound data structure that holds values that you can manipulate. A reference variable does \nnot store its own values. Instead, when you reference the reference variable, OpenROAD uses the values in the \ncorresponding object. The object is made up of attributes, which can be simple variables, reference variables, or \narray variables.\n\nThe class of an object defines its attributes. OpenROAD includes both system classes and user-defined classes.\n\nIn your 4GL code, when you reference a reference variable, you can work with the entire object as a single unit. For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed.

To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method. Examples of using the Create method \nare provided in \"Creating a Frame at Runtime\" in the Programming Guide."

However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",

For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method.

A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable. If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause. The default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the \n*Language Reference Guide* online help, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default false;\n```\n\nThe with null, not default, and with default (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic compatibility with \nSQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.\n\n## How You Can Use Simple Variables\n\nTo make use of a simple variable, use the variable name. For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable. In the second, \nmovies[].Title is a simple variable that is an element of an array.\n\nFor information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable, see Reference Variables \nand Dynamic Array Variables."

A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable. If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause. The default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the \n*Language Reference Guide* online help, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default false;\n```\n\nThe with null, not default, and with default (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic compatibility with \nSQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.\n\n## How You Can Use Simple Variables\n\nTo make use of a simple variable, use the variable name. For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable. In the second, \nmovies[].Title is a simple variable that is an element of an array.\n\nFor information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable, see Reference Variables \nand Dynamic Array Variables."

            "# Reference Variables\n\nA reference variable is a variable that points to an object of a given class, letting you access the value of an \nobject. An object is a compound data structure that holds values that you can manipulate. A reference variable does \nnot store its own values. Instead, when you reference the reference variable, OpenROAD uses the values in the \ncorresponding object. The object is made up of attributes, which can be simple variables, reference variables, or \narray variables.\n\nThe class of an object defines its attributes. OpenROAD includes both system classes and user-defined classes.\n\nIn your 4GL code, when you reference a reference variable, you can work with the entire object as a single unit. For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method.

A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable. If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause. The default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the \n*Language Reference Guide* online help, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default false;\n```\n\nThe with null, not default, and with default (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic compatibility with \nSQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.\n\n## How You Can Use Simple Variables\n\nTo make use of a simple variable, use the variable name. For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable. In the second, \nmovies[].Title is a simple variable that is an element of an array.\n\nFor information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable, see Reference Variables \nand Dynamic Array Variables."

Instead, when you reference the reference variable, OpenROAD uses the values in the \ncorresponding object. The object is made up of attributes, which can be simple variables, reference variables, or \narray variables.\n\nThe class of an object defines its attributes. OpenROAD includes both system classes and user-defined classes.\n\nIn your 4GL code, when you reference a reference variable, you can work with the entire object as a single unit. For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",

The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method.

In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method. Examples of using the Create method \nare provided in \"Creating a Frame at Runtime\" in the Programming Guide."

For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method.

A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable. If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause. The default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the \n*Language Reference Guide* online help, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default false;\n```\n\nThe with null, not default, and with default (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic compatibility with \nSQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.\n\n## How You Can Use Simple Variables\n\nTo make use of a simple variable, use the variable name. For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable. In the second, \nmovies[].Title is a simple variable that is an element of an array.\n\nFor information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable, see Reference Variables \nand Dynamic Array Variables."

            "# Reference Variables\n\nA reference variable is a variable that points to an object of a given class, letting you access the value of an \nobject. An object is a compound data structure that holds values that you can manipulate. A reference variable does \nnot store its own values. Instead, when you reference the reference variable, OpenROAD uses the values in the \ncorresponding object. The object is made up of attributes, which can be simple variables, reference variables, or \narray variables.\n\nThe class of an object defines its attributes. OpenROAD includes both system classes and user-defined classes.\n\nIn your 4GL code, when you reference a reference variable, you can work with the entire object as a single unit. For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class.

A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable.

For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable. In the second, \nmovies[].Title is a simple variable that is an element of an array.\n\nFor information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable, see Reference Variables \nand Dynamic Array Variables."

            "# Reference Variables\n\nA reference variable is a variable that points to an object of a given class, letting you access the value of an \nobject. An object is a compound data structure that holds values that you can manipulate. A reference variable does \nnot store its own values. Instead, when you reference the reference variable, OpenROAD uses the values in the \ncorresponding object. The object is made up of attributes, which can be simple variables, reference variables, or \narray variables.\n\nThe class of an object defines its attributes. OpenROAD includes both system classes and user-defined classes.\n\nIn your 4GL code, when you reference a reference variable, you can work with the entire object as a single unit. For \nexample, you can retrieve a row from a database table and assign all values from the row to a single object and then \npass the object to a called procedure. You can also work with the individual attributes in the object.\n\n## How You Can Declare Reference Variables\n\nTo declare a reference variable, use the following syntax:\n\n```\nname = class [ [with] default null]\n```\n\nThe value of class can be any named user class or system class (for a complete list of system classes, see the \nLanguage Reference Guide online help). The following example declares a reference variable of the StringObject class:\n\n```\nstrobj = StringObject;\n```\n\nAll reference variables are nullable.\n\nWhen you create a field on a form, you specify the variable's name and data type on the field's property inspector in \nthe OpenROAD Workbench. Unless you specify otherwise, OpenROAD automatically declares the variable that you use to \naccess the data in that field. If the field is a named composite field, such as a stackfield or subform, the variable \nis a reference variable and you may or may not define its data type (class).\n\nIf you do define the data type for the reference variable, the data type must be a system or user class name. You can \nchoose to exclude fields for some of the attributes (this provides a way to keep additional undisplayed control \ninformation).\n\nIf you do not name the class when you create a composite field, OpenROAD creates an unnamed class that you can \nreference only within the frame that contains the composite field.\n\n## How You Can Use Reference Variables\n\nIn OpenROAD, you can work with an object as a whole or with the attributes of the object. To manipulate the object as \na single unit, use the name of the object's reference variable in your 4GL code.\n\nFor example, you can create a subform and specify its variable's class as a named user class. In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method.

In your program you \ncould then pass the values in the subform fields to a procedure simply by naming the variable as a procedure \nparameter.\n\nIn the following statement, customer is the name of the variable associated with a subform:\n\n```\ncallproc update_cust (new = customer)\n```\n\nTo access an individual attribute that belongs to an object, use the dot notation:\n\n```\nreferencevariable_name.attribute_name\n```\n\nFor example, assume that the subform previously described contained a field called Address. To reference that field, \nyou would use:\n\n```\ncustomer.Address\n```\n\nIn the following example, City and Street are attributes of class addr, and address is a declared reference variable:\n\n```\naddress.City = 'Dallas';\nx = address.Street;\ncallframe delete_old (address = address.City);\n```\n\nOpenROAD checks references to attributes by name and produces compiler errors if the variable's class does not \ncontain those attributes. For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method. Examples of using the Create method \nare provided in \"Creating a Frame at Runtime\" in the Programming Guide."

For example, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\ntmp_char = varchar(30) not null;\n```\n\nSome valid references would be:\n\n```\na.Street = tmp_char;\ntmp_char = a.city;\n```\n\nSome invalid references would be:\n\n```\na.Province = tmp_char;  /*  ERROR at compile time\n                        ** because attribute 'province'\n                        ** is not defined for class 'addr' */\na = null;\na.Street = tmp_char;    /*  ERROR at runtime because 'a' is\n                        ** null, and does not reference\n                        ** an object */\n```\n\n## Null Reference Variables\n\nWhen you declare a reference variable without specifying default null, the variable points to an object whose \nattributes are automatically initialized with the default values given in the definition of the object. However, you \ncan set a reference variable to null. A reference variable that is set to null does not point to any object. Whenever \nall reference variables for an object have been redirected or set to null, OpenROAD frees the associated object, for \nexample, given the following declarations:\n\n```\na = Addr;\nb = Addr;\n```\n\nThe consequences of resetting the variables a and b would be:\n\n```\na = b;     /*  The original object for a is freed. Now\n            ** both a and b point to the same object. */\na = null;  /*  The object created for b still has 1\n            ** reference (b). */\nb = null:  /*  The object created for b is freed. */\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can specify default null on the declaration and a default object is not created.\n\nYou can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:",
            "You can check for a null reference variable with the is null operator, for example:\n\n```\nif a is null then\n    /* processing statements */\nendif;\n```\n\nFor more information about null reference variables, see Nulls in Expressions.\n\n## How You Can Create Objects for Reference Variables\n\nYou may need to create an object for a reference variable. For example, dynamic programs can create fields or forms \nat runtime by using the Create method, defined for the Class class. The Create method returns an object of a \nspecified class.\n\nIn the following example, the reference variable a is declared with a default value of null:\n\n```\na = Addr default null;\n```\n\nAnd a new object is created for it:\n\n```\na = Addr.Create();    /* Creates an Addr object */\na.Street = 'main street';\na.City = 'dallas';\n```\n\nFor more information about the Create method, see the Class class Create Method. Examples of using the Create method \nare provided in \"Creating a Frame at Runtime\" in the Programming Guide."
