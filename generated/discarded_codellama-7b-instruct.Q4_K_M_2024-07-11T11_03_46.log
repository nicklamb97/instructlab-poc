2024-07-11T11:22:55 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nTask 1: How does the 'to' and 'downto' keywords affect the Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement?\n\nThe for loop can only increment or decrement in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD. This is because the for statement uses integer expressions to specify the starting value of the index variable and the ending value of the index variable. To cause the index variable to increment, use a positive expression in startexpression. For example:\n```\nfor i = 10 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statements */\nendfor;\n```\nTo cause the index variable to decrement, use a negative expression in startexpression. For example:\n```\nfor i = -10 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statements */\nendfor;\n```\nThe value of endexpression affects when the for loop terminates. When the index variable is incremented or decremented, it is compared to endexpression in each iteration of the loop. If the expression is true (i.e., indexvariable > endexpression (to) or indexvariable < endexpression (downto)), the for loop terminates.\n\nFor example, if startexpression is 1 and endexpression is 50, the following for loop increments i by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches 50:\n```\nfor i = 1 to 50 do\n     /* statements */\nendfor;\n```\nTask 2: What is the difference between an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Loop and an Actian 4GL OpenROAD While Loop?\n\nAn Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Loop repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as a specified expression evaluates to true. An Actian 4GL OpenROAD While Loop repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as a specified condition is true. In the for loop, you specify when to terminate the loop by setting the index variable to endexpression. For example:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statements */\nendfor;\n```\nIn the while loop, you specify the condition to test at the beginning of each iteration using the expression in the while statement. Then, you specify when to terminate the loop by breaking out of the loop with a break or continue statement. For example:\n```\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statements */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          endloop;\n     endif;\nendfor;\n```\nTask 3: What is the purpose of using a label with the continue statement in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Loop?\n\nIf you use a label with the continue statement, you can specify which loop you want to continue. This allows you to break out of a nested series of loops. In this case, the continue statement should be followed by the label. For example:\n```\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statements */\n     label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statements */\n          if arr.Name = '' then\n               continue label1;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```"

The specified indexvariable is incremented (if to is specified) or decremented (if downto is specified) after each iteration of the series of statements. The series of statements is executed until the indexvariable exceeds (to) or becomes less than (downto) the specified endexpression. This test is performed before each iteration (thus, it is possible for no iterations to be executed). The specified endexpression is re-evaluated for each test.\n\n**Note:** You can nest for statements in OpenROAD.\n\n### Breaking Out of For Loops\n\nTo break out of a for loop, you can use the endloop, continue, resume, or return statement.\n\nIf you use the endloop statement, OpenROAD closes the loop immediately and continues execution with the first statement following the endfor statement. For example:\n```\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          endloop label2;\n     elseif arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n          endloop label3;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor;\n```\nIf condition is true, statementlist2 is not executed in that pass through the loop, and control resumes at the next iteration of loop1 or loop2. If neither condition is true, loop3 is closed, and the entire for loop is closed.\n\n"

What are the requirements for this task set?\n\n1. Please do not repeat the verb for each instruction.\n2. The language used should be diverse.\n3. Try to provide instructions that ask a question or contain an imperative sentence.\n4. The type of instructions should be similar to what is provided in the document.\n5. The output should be appropriate and as long as possible.\n6. Only English instructions are accepted.\n7. The instructions should be 1-2 sentences long.\n<|user|>\nSounds good! I will follow those requirements. Here are my first five tasks:\n\nTask 1: What is the name of this AI language model?\n\nInstruction: Can you explain the concept and usage of \'For Statement\' in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: This statement repeats a series of statements, incrementing or decrementing an index variable. The for statement also called the for loop repetitively executes the series of statements in the statementlist between do and endfor keywords. The specified indexvariable is incremented (if to is specified) or decremented (if downto is specified) after each iteration of the series of statements. The series of statements is executed until the indexvariable exceeds (to) or becomes less than (downto) the specified endexpression. This test is performed before each iteration (thus, it is possible for no iterations to be executed). The specified endexpression is re-evaluated for each test.\n\nTask 2: How does this statement end?\nInstruction: Can you give an example of how to use \'For Statement\' in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: Use the for loop to increment through an array:\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     arr[i].PaymentReceived = TRUE;\nendfor;\n\nTask 3: How does the index variable change during execution of this statement?\nInstruction: What happens if a label is specified for a for loop in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: When you use labels, you can use nested for statements in OpenROAD and control breaking out of nested loops by using endloop or continue statements. Both the endloop statement lets you specify labels and specify a label with the continue statement lets you specify which loop to continue.\n\nTask 4: What does this mean?\nInstruction: Can you provide examples on how to break out of a for loop in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: You can use nested for statements in OpenROAD and control breaking out of nested loops by using endloop or continue statements. Both the endloop statement lets you specify labels and specify a label with the continue statement lets you specify which loop to continue.\n\nTask 5: How does this affect execution?\nInstruction: What are the requirements for parameters of a for statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: The for statement has the following parameters: label, indexvariable, startexpression, and endexpression. The specified indexvariable is incremented (to) or decremented (downto) after each iteration of the loop. Its contents upon exit from the loop are undefined.'

Statementlist specifies a series of statements that are executed repeatedly.\n\nThe following example shows how you can use the For statement in OpenROAD Actian 4GL:\n```\nfor i = 1 to array.Lastrow do\n     arr[i].PaymentReceived = TRUE;\nendfor;\n```\nThis code sets the PaymentReceived field of each row in the array named array to TRUE.\n<|assistant|>\nCan you please give an example of how a nested for loop can be used in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?\n\n<|user|>\nYes, here is an example:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.Name = '' then\n               endloop;\n          elseif arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               continue;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```\nThe loop1 for loop iterates through each row in the array named arr, and when it finds a non-empty string (arr.Name = '') or FALSE (arr.FullTime = FALSE), it breaks out of that iteration with endloop. When the inner for loop completes without finding any condition that would cause the breakout, it iterates to the next row in outer loop1 (i + 1). The execution continues until all rows are processed and then the outer loop also ends with control passing to statementlist4 following endfor.\n"

For example, you can loop through a list and set an array's value or perform a function on the elements of an array. The syntax for a for statement is as follows:\n```\nfor <indexvariable>=<startexpression> to|downto <endexpression> do \n   <statementlist> \nendfor;\n```\nThe loop repeats the statements in the <statementlist> between the do and endfor keywords until the index variable exceeds (to) or becomes less than (downto) the specified endexpression. The endexpression is re-evaluated for each test, so it must be a constant expression that does not change during the loop.\n\nIf you need to exit early from a for loop, you can use the endfor statement with a label and the continue statement with a label. For example:\n```\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /*statementlist1*/\n     if arr[i].Name = '' then\n          endloop label2;\n     elseif arr[i].FullTime = FALSE then\n          continue label1;\n     endif;\n     /*statementlist2*/\nendfor;\n```\nYou can also use break statements to exit loops early. However, the break statement only exits one loop level, so you must nest your for loops appropriately if you want to break out of multiple levels of nested loops."

If you use the endloop statement, OpenROAD closes the loop immediately and continues execution with the first statement following the endfor statement. For example:```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          endloop;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor;\n```If condition is true, statementlist2 is not executed in that pass through the loop, and the entire loop is closed.If you use the continue statement, OpenROAD skips the remaining statements in the statement list, increments or decrements the index variable, and begins the next iteration of the loop. For example:```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          continue;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor;\n```If condition is true, statementlist2 is not executed in that pass through the loop, and execution continues with the next iteration of the loop.If you use the resume statement, OpenROAD terminates both the loop and the current event block.If you use the return statement, OpenROAD terminates the current frame, procedure, or method. You can also use nested for statements in 4GL, and you can control breaking out of nested loops by using labels. Both the endloop and the continue statements let you specify labels. Specifying a label with the endloop statement lets you break to a specific level. For example:```\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.Name = '' then\n               endloop label1;\n          elseif arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               endloop label2;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```There are two possible breaks out of the inner loop. If condition1 is true, both loops are closed, and control resumes at the statement following the outer loop. If condition2 is true, only the inner loop is closed, and execution continues at the beginning of statementlist4.If no label is specified after endloop, OpenROAD terminates only the loop that issued the endloop statement.Specifying a label with the continue statement lets you specify which loop you want to continue. For example:```\nloop1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     loop2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               continue loop1;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```Whenever condition occurs, loop2 is abandoned and control goes to the next iteration of loop1.\n"

2024-07-11T14:07:24 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat are the different types of for statements available in Actian 4GL?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThere are three different types of For Statements available in OpenROAD Actian 4GL:\n1. Classic For Statement: This type of for statement is the most common and allows to iterate through a list of records with each record being processed one by one without the need of processing all records at once. This type of For statement does not support nested loops.\n2. Nested For Statements: This type of For statement allows to iterate through records inside other iterations where other statements can be executed.\n3. Enhanced For Statement: This type of For statement is similar to the Classic For statement but it includes more advanced features such as nested for statements, break and continue statements, labels for ending loops, and support for multiple conditions.\n'
2024-07-11T14:11:32 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nTask 1: What is the purpose of labels in nested Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statements?\n\n<|user|>\nLabels in nested Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statements allow control over breaking out of specific levels of nested loops using endloop or continue statements.\n\n<|assistant|>\nTask 2: What is the purpose of an endloop statement in OpenROAD Actian 4GL For Statement?\n\n<|user|>\nThe endloop statement breaks out of the for loop, and execution resumes with the next statement after the for statement.\n\n<|assistant|>\nTask 3: What is the purpose of a continue statement in OpenROAD Actian 4GL For Statement?\n\n<|user|>\nThe continue statement skips to the next iteration of the loop, increments or decrements the index variable, and begins the next iteration of the for loop.\n\n<|assistant|>\nTask 4: What are the limitations of using endloop or continue statements in Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statements?\n\n<|user|>\nYou can use nested for statements in Actian 4GL OpenROAD, and you can control breaking out of nested loops by using labels. Both endloop and continue statements let you specify labels. Specifying a label with the endloop statement lets you break to a specific level. For example:\n```\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.Name = '' then\n               endloop label1;\n          elseif arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               endloop label2;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```\nThere are two possible breaks out of the inner loop. If condition1 is true, both loops are closed, and control resumes at the statement following the outer loop. If condition2 is true, only the inner loop is closed, and execution continues at the beginning of statementlist4.\n\nIf no label is specified after endloop, OpenROAD terminates only the loop that issued the endloop statement. Specifying a label with the continue statement lets you specify which loop you want to continue. For example:\n```\nloop1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     loop2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               continue loop1;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```\nWhenever condition occurs, loop2 is abandoned and control goes to the next iteration of loop1.\n\n<|assistant|>\nTask 5: Provide a sample code using nested OpenROAD Actian 4GL For Statements using labels to demonstrate the ability of an endloop or continue statement to break out of specific levels of nested loops.\n\n<|user|>\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.Name = '' then\n               endloop label1;\n          elseif arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               endloop label2;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n\n<|assistant|>\nTask 6: What are the differences between using a for and while loop in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?\n\n<|user|>\nWhile loops can be used to iterate through a collection of items, and they do not require an index variable.

2024-07-11T14:45:26 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nAn Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement is a repetitive statement that repeatedly executes a series of statements between the do and endfor keywords until a specified condition is no longer true. The for statement has a syntax like this:\n\n```\n[label:] for indexvariable = startexpression to|downto endexpression\n                    do statementlist\n        endfor;\n```\nThe index variable is incremented or decremented after each iteration of the loop until the index variable exceeds (to) or becomes less than (downto) the specified end expression. The specified end expression is reevaluated for each comparison. If the index variable does not exceed (to) or become less than (downto) the specified end expression, then the series of statements between the do and endfor keywords are executed repeatedly until the index variable no longer equals the specified start expression. This test is performed before each iteration (thus, it is possible for no iterations to be executed). The specified end expression can be any valid 4GL expression that produces an integer value. The start expression must produce an integer value, and the indexvariable may also produce an integer value.\n\nHere is a sample code snippet that illustrates the use of the For statement:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist */\nendfor;\n```\nThe For statement is often used in conjunction with arrays to iterate over each element of an array. For example:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     if arr[i].Name = 'Bob' then\n          /* statementlist */\n          break;\n     endif;\nendfor;\n```\nThe for loop is a simple way to perform iterations in OpenROAD.

For example, if we know there are items in an array and want to process each item, we can use a for loop without needing to know how many items the array contains or what those values are. We also cannot get out of a for loop by accident because it always runs through all items in an array before stopping. This is helpful when we do not know exactly how many times a statement should be executed, which is a common case in programming.\n'

2024-07-11T15:11:06 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nTask: Explain the concept and usage of 'For Statement' in OpenROAD Actian 4GL.\n\n**Answer**\nThe for statement is used to perform a series of actions repeatedly while incrementing or decrementing an index variable. It repeats a specified sequence of statements, until the index variable exceeds or becomes less than a certain value. The for statement is a useful construct in 4GL programming languages to replace the traditional use of while loops or for loops.\n\nFor example, we can write a program that calculates the area of a circle using the following code:\n```\nfor (int i = 0; i < 360; ++i) {\n    // calculate the x coordinate of the point on the circle\n    double x = Math.cos(Math.toRadians(i)) * radius;\n    // calculate the y coordinate of the point on the circle\n    double y = Math.sin(Math.toRadians(i)) * radius;\n    // add the current point to the list of points\n    points.add(new Point2D.Double(x, y));\n}\n```"

2024-07-11T15:13:38 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nTask 1\nWhat is the difference between the Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement's continue statement and its endloop statement?\nThe main difference between these two statements is that the endloop statement breaks out of a nested series of for or while loops to a specified level, while the continue statement skips over a single iteration (statementlist2) within the current loop and continues execution with the next iteration (statementlist3). Both of these statements also break out of the loop.\nTask 2\nHow do you break out of a For Loop in Actian 4GL?\nTo break out of a for loop, you can use the endloop, continue, resume, or return statement. If you use the endloop statement, OpenROAD closes the loop immediately and continues execution with the first statement following the endfor statement. For example: `for i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do /* statementlist1 */ if arr.Name = '' then endloop; /* statementlist2 */ endfor;` If condition is true, statementlist2 is not executed in that pass through the loop, and the entire loop is closed.\n"

With a label in the continue statement, you can specify the break location and also skip to a specific loop.\n'

2024-07-11T15:29:11 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nTask 1: What are the different ways to break out of a For Loop?\n\nAnswer: You can use the endloop, continue, resume, or return statement. If you use the endloop statement, OpenROAD closes the loop immediately and continues execution with the first statement following the endfor statement. For example: ``` for i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          endloop;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor; ``` If condition is true, statementlist2 is not executed in that pass through the loop, and the entire loop is closed.\n\nIf you use the continue statement, OpenROAD skips the remaining statements in the statement list, increments or decrements the index variable, and begins the next iteration of the loop. For example: ``` for i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          continue;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor; ``` If condition is true, statementlist2 is not executed in that pass through the loop, and execution continues with the next iteration of the loop.\n\nIf you use the resume statement, OpenROAD terminates both the loop and the current event block.\n\nIf you use the return statement, OpenROAD terminates the current frame, procedure, or method. You can also use nested for statements in 4GL, and you can control breaking out of nested loops by using labels. Both the endloop and the continue statements let you specify labels. Specifying a label with the endloop statement lets you break to a specific level. For example: ``` label1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.Name = '' then\n               endloop label1;\n          elseif arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               endloop label2;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor; ``` There are two possible breaks out of the inner loop. If condition1 is true, both loops are closed, and control resumes at the statement following the outer loop. If condition2 is true, only the inner loop is closed, and execution continues at the beginning of statementlist4.\n\nIf no label is specified after endloop, OpenROAD terminates only the loop that issued the endloop statement.\n\nSpecifying a label with the continue statement lets you specify which loop you want to continue. For example: ``` loop1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     loop2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               continue loop1;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor; ``` Whenever condition occurs, loop2 is abandoned and control goes to the next iteration of loop1.\n"

Here is an overview of the for statement in OpenROAD Actian 4GL:\n\n```\nfor [label:] indexvariable = startexpression\n                to|downto endexpression\n                do statementlist\nendfor;\n```\nThe for statement repeats a set of statements. The indexvariable is incremented (to) or decremented (downto) after each iteration of the set of statements in the statement list between the do and endfor keywords. The series of statements is executed until the index variable exceeds (to) or becomes less than (downto) the specified endexpression.\n\nYou can nest for statements, and you can use labels to control breaking out of nested loops. There are four ways to break out of a loop: endloop, continue, resume, and return.\n\nHere are some more detailed explanations:\n\n* For example: You can break out of a loop using the endloop statement:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          endloop;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor;\n```\nIf condition is true, OpenROAD closes the loop immediately and continues execution with the first statement following the endfor statement. For example:\n\n* You can break out of a loop using the continue statement:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          continue;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor;\n```\nIf condition is true, OpenROAD skips the remaining statements in the statement list and increments or decrements the index variable and begins the next iteration of the loop. For example:\n* You can break out of a loop using the resume statement:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          resume;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor;\n```\nIf condition is true, OpenROAD terminates both the loop and the current event block.\n* You can break out of a loop using the return statement:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          return;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor;\n```\nIf condition is true, OpenROAD terminates the current frame, procedure, or method.\n* You can break out of a loop using the endloop statement and labels:\n```\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.Name = '' then\n               endloop label1;\n          elseif arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               endloop label2;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```\nThere are two possible breaks out of the inner loop. If condition1 is true, both loops are closed, and control resumes at the statement following the outer loop. If condition2 is true, only the inner loop is closed, and execution continues at the beginning of statementlist4.\n\nIf no label is specified after endloop, OpenROAD terminates only the loop that issued the endloop statement.\n* You can break out of a loop using the continue statement and labels:\n```\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               continue label1;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```\nWhenever condition occurs, loop2 is abandoned and control goes to the next iteration of loop1.\n* Another feature that is specific to Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement is that you can use labels to specify which loop to break out of using continue statement:\n```\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               continue label1;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```\nWhenever condition occurs, loop2 is abandoned and control goes to the next iteration of loop1.\n\n<|assistant|>\nI'm interested in learning more about OpenROAD Actian 4GL For Statement.

The specified indexvariable is incremented (if to is specified) or decremented (if downto is specified) after each iteration of the series of statements. The series of statements is executed until the indexvariable exceeds (to) or becomes less than (downto) the specified endexpression. This test is performed before each iteration (thus, it is possible for no iterations to be executed). The specified endexpression is re-evaluated for each test.\n\n**Note:** You can nest for statements in OpenROAD.\n\n### Breaking Out of For Loops\n\nTo break out of a for loop, you can use the endloop, continue, resume, or return statement.\n\nIf you use the endloop statement, OpenROAD closes the loop immediately and continues execution with the first statement following the endfor statement. For example:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          endloop;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor;\n```\nIf condition is true, statementlist2 is not executed in that pass through the loop, and the entire loop is closed.\n\nIf you use the continue statement, OpenROAD skips the remaining statements in the statement list, increments or decrements the index variable, and begins the next iteration of the loop. For example:\n```\nfor i = 1 to arr.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     if arr.Name = '' then\n          continue;\n     endif;\n     /* statementlist2 */\nendfor;\n```\nIf condition is true, statementlist2 is not executed in that pass through the loop, and execution continues with the next iteration of the loop.\n\nIf you use the resume statement, OpenROAD terminates both the loop and the current event block.\n\nIf you use the return statement, OpenROAD terminates the current frame, procedure, or method.\n\nYou can use nested for statements in 4GL, and you can control breaking out of nested loops by using labels. Both the endloop and the continue statements let you specify labels. Specifying a label with the endloop statement lets you break to a specific level. For example:\n```\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.Name = '' then\n               endloop label1;\n          elseif arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               endloop label2;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```\nThere are two possible breaks out of the inner loop. If condition1 is true, both loops are closed, and control resumes at the statement following the outer loop. If condition2 is true, only the inner loop is closed, and execution continues at the beginning of statementlist4.\n\nIf no label is specified after endloop, OpenROAD terminates only the loop that issued the endloop statement.\n\nSpecifying a label with the continue statement lets you specify which loop you want to continue. For example:\n```\nloop1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     loop2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               continue loop1;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```\nWhenever condition occurs, loop2 is abandoned and control goes to the next iteration of loop1.\n\nIf no label is specified after continue, OpenROAD continues with the next iteration of the current for loop.\n\n### Parameters--For Statement\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n#### label\nSpecifies a character string identifying each for statement. The label allows an endloop or continue statement to break out of a nested series of for or while statements to a specified level. The label precedes the for keyword and is followed by a colon. The label must be a unique alphanumeric identifier and not a keyword.\n\n#### indexvariable\nSpecifies an integer variable that is incremented (to) or decremented (downto) after each iteration of the for loop. Its contents upon exit from the for loop are undefined.\n\n#### startexpression\nSpecifies an integer expression to which the indexvariable is set before the first iteration of the for loop.\n\n#### endexpression\nSpecifies an integer expression to which indexvariable is compared before each iteration of the for loop (including the first iteration). It is re-evaluated for each comparison.\n\nIf indexvariable > endexpression (to) or indexvariable < endexpression (downto), the for loop is terminated.\n\n#### statementlist\nSee StatementList.\n\n### Example--For Statement\nUse the for loop to increment through an array:\n```\nfor i = 1 to array.Lastrow do\n     arr[i].PaymentReceived = TRUE;\nendfor;\n```\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n"

For example:\n```\nlabel1: for i = 1 to arr1.Lastrow do\n     /* statementlist1 */\n     label2: for j = 1 to arr2.Lastrow do\n          /* statementlist2 */\n          if arr.Name = '' then\n               endloop label1;\n          elseif arr.FullTime = FALSE then\n               endloop label2;\n          endif;\n          /* statementlist3 */\n     endfor;\n     /* statementlist4 */\nendfor;\n```\n"

How can we use break to leave a loop early?\n\n<|system|>\nIn an Actian 4GL OpenROAD, you can exit a For Statement and skip the remaining iterations of the For Statement by using the 'endloop' statement. You can also specify which nested For loops are closed with a label, so that the end loop statement breaks out to a specific level of the for statements.\n\n<|user|>\nGreat! So in general, we can break out of a loop early with 'break' and exit out of multiple nested loops by specifying a label. Is that correct?\n\n<|assistant|>\nYes! That is correct. You can use the endloop statement to specify which label you want to break out to. When the label is specified, it will only close the inner-most loop. This allows us to break out of multiple nested loops early without having to use multiple continue statements or nest a lot of for loops in each other.\n\n"
