The syntax is as follows:\nvariable = expression;\nwhere 'variable' is the name of the variable you want to set. 'Expression' is any valid expression that represents \nthe desired value for the variable. For example, you can use literals like strings or numeric values. You can also use \noperators such as arithmetic or logical ones. Here are some examples:\n- i = 3;  # Integer variable 'i' is set to the number three.\n- name = 'Mary';  # String variable 'name' is set to the value 'Mary'.\n- total = 123.75;  # Numeric variable 'total' is set to the float value 123.75.\n- enabled = false;  # Boolean variable 'enabled' is set to the false value (representing the off state)."}

You can also specify constructor arguments in parentheses \nafter the class name. For example, here are some common constructors:\n- Person person = new Person('John', 'Smith');  # Creates a new Person object with the given first and last names.\n- Car car = new Car(4, 'Volvo', '745-ABC');  # Creates a new Car object with the specified make, model, and \nlicense plate."}

This \ncondition checks for true values of this variable and sets 'membershipStatus' to 'Premium'. For false values, it sets \n'membershipStatus' to 'Regular'."}

In the first example, \nthe condition checks if the person is a premium member. If not, it then checks if their age is greater than 60 or if their \ntotal purchase amount is greater than $100. In the second example, the condition checks if the person is not a premium \nmember. If so, it then checks three conditions: their membership status is 'Regular', their age is greater than 60, or their \ntotal purchase amount is greater than $100. Another difference is how they output the results. The first example uses \n`Console.WriteLine()` statements to display the variables and their values, while the second example defines the variables \nand then displays them using the `DISPLAY` statement."}

In contrast, Actian 4GL is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables do not require a declaration of their type. Another difference is how they handle strings. In C#, strings are represented as a character array, whereas in Actian 4GL, strings are simply represented as text values. Yet another difference is how they manage memory allocation. In C#, memory is managed automatically by the runtime system, whereas in Actian 4GL, memory must be explicitly managed by the developer using statements such as ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE."}
