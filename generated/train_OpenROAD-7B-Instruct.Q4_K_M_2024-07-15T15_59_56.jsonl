You can then add any number of fields, menu items, or other objects to this dialog using their respective statements. For example:\n```\nentry(label).value = 'Customer:';\nmenu item(label).caption = 'Order Type:';\nbutton(caption = 'Place Order').action = this.entry(label).value;\n```\nThese statements create three new elements in the dialog: an entry field named 'Customer', a menu item named 'Order Type', and a button named 'Place Order'. The button is connected to the entry field so when you click it, Actian 4GL OpenROAD sets the value of that field to whatever you typed into it."}
