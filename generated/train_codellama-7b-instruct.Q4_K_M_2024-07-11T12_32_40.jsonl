For example:\n```\nif condition then\n    statement;\nelseif condition then\n    statement;\nendif;\n```\nThe above statement will execute the 'statement' when the 'condition' is true and will execute another set of statements when the 'elseif condition' is true, otherwise it will not execute any branch if both conditions are false or null."}

The elseif variant allows you to test an expression, then execute a set of statements in case that the expression is false or null, followed by a further test and a set of statements if both tests are false. For example, you can use an elseif variant in OpenROAD Actian 4GL to control the flow of frames within an application based on multiple specific conditions and provide default statements when all other conditions are false."}
