For instance:\n* The '+ 'operator adds two numbers together.\n* The '- 'operator subtracts one quantity from another.\n* The '* 'operator multiplies two quantities with each other.\n* The '% 'operator calculates the remainder of dividing one number by another.\n* The '< 'operator checks if a number is less than another.\n* The '> 'operator verifies if a number is bigger than another.\n* The '<= 'operator confirms if a quantity is lower or equivalent to one more.\n* The '>= 'operator verifies if a quantity is greater or similar to another.\n* The '== 'operator confirms that two variables have the same value.\n* The '!=' operator confirms that two variables do not have the very same worth.\n* The '&& 'operator executes two expressions and returns true just if both expressions are real.\n* The '|| 'operator carries out two expressions and returns true if at least one of the expressions is actual.\nThese operators offer you versatility when working with various kinds of data, including numeric and string values.
