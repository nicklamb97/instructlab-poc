For example, if two developers both use `myVariable` for different variables in their code, it could lead to issues down the line when they try to integrate their code or when someone else tries to maintain or modify the code.\n- Consistent naming conventions can also help with documentation and version control. If all elements in your program follow a specific naming pattern, it's easier for tools to generate documentation or automatically update your code when changes are made. For instance, if you use a certain prefix (e.g., `my_` or `db_`) for database-related variables, IDEs and version control systems can easily identify and group them together, making it simpler to manage and maintain your code.",
