{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What types of procedures can be called using the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?", "assistant": "The Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement can call global or local procedures written in 4GL, and procedures written in other high-level programming languages (3GL languages such as C or FORTRAN)."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the basic syntax of an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?", "assistant": "The basic syntax is: [returnvariable =] callproc procname[(parameterlist)];"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement handle procedure name resolution?", "assistant": "If an actual procedure name is used, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time. If a variable is used, the procedure reference is resolved at runtime."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How can parameters be passed in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?", "assistant": "Parameters can be passed by value or by reference. To pass values by reference, the byref(variable) option is used."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the importance of data type compatibility in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?", "assistant": "The data type of the variable receiving the return value must be compatible with the return type of the called procedure. For database procedures, the return type is always integer."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement be used without the 'callproc' keyword?", "assistant": "Yes, when calling a procedure as part of an expression, the 'callproc' keyword is not needed."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the 'returnvariable' parameter in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?", "assistant": "The 'returnvariable' specifies the name of the variable in the calling frame or procedure that receives the return value from the called procedure."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How should procedure names that are the same as 4GL keywords be handled in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?", "assistant": "Procedure names that are the same as 4GL keywords must be enclosed in single quotes."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the difference between using NamedParameterList and UnnamedParameterList in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?", "assistant": "NamedParameterList is used for 4GL procedures, while UnnamedParameterList is used for 3GL procedures."}
