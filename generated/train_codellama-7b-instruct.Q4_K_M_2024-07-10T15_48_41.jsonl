You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Explain how to create and use a subquery in OpenROAD Actian 4GL SQL.", "assistant": "To create a subquery, we must first understand the purpose of using it. A subquery is used to find rows that meet certain criteria based on other rows. We can then nest the subquery within another query. This allows us to select data from multiple tables or views and perform operations such as aggregation functions.\n\nTo use a subquery in OpenROAD Actian 4GL SQL, we must first create the subquery and give it a name. Once given a name, we can reference that subquery by using its alias in another query. In the following example, the subquery is called \"subqry_emp\".\n\n```sql\nCREATE VIEW subqry_emp AS \n    SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee);\n```\n\nThe above subquery is an example of a correlated subquery. The subquery calculates the average salary and uses that number in the where clause to select rows with salaries greater than that. Note that because this subquery uses data from another table (employee), we can only create it by referencing the employee table explicitly or by creating a view that references employee.\n\nOnce created, we can use the subquery in other queries by using its alias. For example:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM subqry_emp;\n```\n\nOutput:\n| emp_id |   name | dept | salary |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 102 | John Smith | Acct | 65,000 |\n| 103 | Jane Doe | Sales | 80,000 |\n\nIn this case, the subquery returns all employees who earn more than the average salary. Note that because we created the subquery based on the employee table, it can only be used in other queries referencing the same table."}
