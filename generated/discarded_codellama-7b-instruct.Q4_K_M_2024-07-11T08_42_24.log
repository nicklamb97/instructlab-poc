These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should be similar to provided examples. The generated instruction and the output should be grounded in the provided document.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. The output should be an appropriate response to the input and the instruction. Long outputs are preferable.\n\nBased on below document provide a list of 5 tasks:\n\nDocument:\n# Field and Menu Item Variables\n\nField and menu item variables are variables that are associated with the *value* in a field or menu item. These \nvariables are not associated with the object represented by the field or menu item.\n\nWhen you create a field or menu item in OpenROAD Workbench, you generally specify a variable name on the Property \nInspector. This variable is associated with the data displayed in the field. You can reference this variable in your \n4GL code whenever you need to access the data in the field.\n\nFor example, assume that you create an entry field and enter the variable name as *title*. You can set the value in \nthat field with the following statement:\n\n```\ntitle = \'Destry Rides Again\';\n```\n\nIt is not necessary to declare field and menu item variables in your scripts; OpenROAD declares them automatically \nwhen you create the field or menu item in OpenROAD Workbench.\n\nTo reference the object represented by a field or menu item instead of its value, use the FIELD() function, as \ndescribed in Field Function, with the field or menu item variable. For example:\n\n```\nFIELD(title).BgColor = CC_ORANGE;\n```\n\nFor more information about the field function, see Field Function.\n\n# How You Can Initialize Variables\n\nWhen OpenROAD starts an application, any global variables associated with the application are initialized. Similarly, \nwhen you call a frame or procedure, OpenROAD initializes the variables associated with the frame or procedure.\n\nOpenROAD uses the default value of the variable as the initial setting. For field and menu items or global variables, \nyou can define this value in the OpenROAD Workbench. If you do not, OpenROAD uses the system defaults. OpenROAD also \nuses the system default for variables declared in the initialize statement of a frame script.\n\nFor simple variables, the system defaults are zero for numeric data types, or the empty string (\'\') for non-nullable \ncharacter data types. However, you can overwrite these defaults using the default clause, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default 3;\n```\n\nFor reference variables, OpenROAD creates an object of the declared class and sets the reference variable to \nreference that object. The attributes of this object are initialized to their default values (which are specified in \nthe class definition). For attributes that are reference variables, you can set the initial value of the variable to \nnull. In this case, no object is created for the reference variable.\n\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n'

2024-07-11T09:56:06 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nI\'m sorry but I am not sure what you mean by "memory addresses". OpenROAD variables are stored on disk and we do not have direct access to the memory address of the objects they reference. So how can I help?\n'
2024-07-11T09:56:06 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n\n<|user|>\nYes, but in OpenROAD Actian 4GL, the type of variable you declare determines whether it is a non-reference or reference variable. For example:\n```\nclass C\n{\n   integer x;\n   integer y;\n};\n```\nHere, ix and iy are declared as integers, which are non-reference variables. If we had declared them as references, they would have been declared like this:\n```\nclass C\n{\n   integer* x;\n   integer* y;\n};\n```\nIn OpenROAD Actian 4GL, a reference variable is an object that can be used to refer to other objects. For example, you \ncan declare variables ix and iy to hold the memory addresses of another class:\n```\nclass C\n{\n   integer x;\n   integer y;\n};\n```\nHere, ix and iy are declared as integers that can hold the memory addresses of objects of class C. If you assign \nthem an address like this:\n```\nix = new C;\niy = new C;\n```\nThen they refer to two different instances of class C, which is accessed by using the dot notation on ix and iy:\n```\nix.x = 42;\niy.y = -77;\n```\nSo ix and iy can be used in expressions or passed as parameters to functions just like any other integer variable. You \ncan even declare them static so that they are associated with the class rather than a particular instance. Here, the \ncode to initialize a class:\n```\nstatic integer* sx;\nstatic integer* sy;\nclass C\n{\n   integer x;\n   integer y;\n};\n```\nHere, sx and sy are declared as static integers that hold memory addresses of instances of class C. They can be \nused anywhere in the application to refer to a specific instance of C:\n```\nsx = new C;\nsy = new C;\nsx.x = 42;\nsy.y = -77;\n```\nSo when you declare a variable as a reference, it means that this variable holds an address in memory where the value can be found. Reference variables are useful when you need to refer to objects of a particular class. However, they have limited uses and are only used in special cases where object references are necessary. The alternative is declaring a variable as a non-reference, which allows you to store the value itself rather than just a memory address to it.'

2024-07-11T10:01:52 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nTask 1\nWhat is a reference variable?\nA reference variable holds a memory address where an object can be found. It can be used to access objects within its scope, but cannot be passed outside of its scope or used in expressions. When you create a class with attributes, the attributes are either non-reference variables (i.e., they hold their value directly) or reference variables (i.e., they hold a memory address where the object can be found). The type of variable determines how it is processed within OpenROAD and whether it can be used as an operand in an expression.\n\nTask 2\nWhat is the FIELD() function?\nThe FIELD() function returns the value stored in the given field. For example:\n```\ninteger i;\ni = 3;\nstring s = FIELD(i).Value; // s now holds "3"\n```\nIn OpenROAD Actian 4GL, you can use the FIELD() function to reference any data stored in a field or menu item.

In this case, no object is created for the reference variable.\nTask 3: What does FIELD(title).BgColor do?\nFIELD(title).BgColor changes the background color of the field referenced by the title variable. This statement changes the background color of a previously described entry field: title = 'Destry Rides Again'; FIELD(title).BgColor = CC_ORANGE; For more information about this function, see Field Function in 4GL Reference.\nTask 4: What does FIELD() do?\nFIELD(title) is a reference to the field referenced by the title variable. For more information about this function, see Field Function in 4GL Reference.\nTask 5: How do you set the initial value of a variable?\nYou can specify an initial value for a variable when you define it. When OpenROAD starts an application, any global variables are initialized. Similarly, when you call a frame or procedure, OpenROAD initializes the variables associated with the frame or procedure. For simple variables, OpenROAD uses the default value of the variable as the initial setting. For reference variables, OpenROAD creates an object of the declared class and sets the reference variable to reference that object. The attributes of this object are initialized to their default values (which are specified in the class definition).\n\n"

2024-07-11T10:52:37 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nHere are some task instructions based on your input:\nTask 1. What is the purpose of global variables in OpenROAD?\nOpenROAD global variables can be accessed and modified from any part of an application, unlike local variables that can only access and modify data within a block of code where they were declared. Global variables are not limited to their creation scope and can be used throughout an application. The following code defines a global variable named *i* with default value 0: i = integer not null default 3;\nTask 2. What is the purpose of local variables?\nOpenROAD local variables have scope that is limited to the block in which they were defined and any blocks contained by them. Local variables are not visible or accessible from outside the block where they are declared. For example, the following code defines a local variable named *i* with default value 0: i = integer;\nTask 3. How do you declare global variables?\nTo declare a global variable in OpenROAD, use the *global* keyword and specify the variable name followed by its data type. For example, the following code defines an integer global variable named *i* with default value 0: i = integer not null default 3;\nTask 4. What are objects?\nObjects are instances of classes. They encapsulate attributes (data) and operations (code) that define their behavior. Objects are created using the new operator and can be destroyed by using delete operator. The object-oriented programming language provides a framework for defining objects, including attributes and methods. For example: *myobject* = new *Object(arg1, arg2)*;\nTask 5. What is method?\nMethod is a function that belongs to an object. It manipulates data associated with the object. A method can have parameters (input arguments) and can return results (output arguments). Methods are invoked by sending them messages. For example, you can create a window by calling the CreateWindow() method: *w* = Window.Create(title, height, width);\nTask 6. How do you initialize variables?\nYou can define a default value for a variable using the *default* clause when you declare it. OpenROAD will use this default value instead of the system defaults (0 for numeric data types or empty string ('') for character data types) if the variable has no initial value specified at the point of its creation. For example: *i* = integer not null default 3;\nTask 7. What are frames?\nFrames are objects that display dialog boxes with buttons and fields to enter data. Frames define what happens when the user clicks a button or selects a field in a form. For example, you can create a window by calling the CreateWindow() method: *w* = Window.Create(title, height, width);\nTask 8. How do you create a frame variable?\nTo declare a frame variable, use the *define* statement in the frame script and specify a type for the variable. For example: define integer i not null default 3;\nTask 9. What is a field function?\nThe FIELD() function is used to reference fields or menu items associated with variables. It returns the value of a field variable and can be used to set its value, for example: *FIELD(i).BgColor* = CC_ORANGE; For more information about this function, see Field Function in 4GL Reference.\nTask 10. What is a menu item?\nA menu item is an option on a menu that invokes a method. When a user selects a menu item, OpenROAD calls the associated method. For example, you can create a File menu with Exit and About options by using the following code: *File* = Menu.Create(title='&File');\n*exitItem* = MenuItem.Create(*File*, title='E&xit', event=@'exit;');\n*aboutItem* = MenuItem.Create(*File*, title='A&bout...', event=@'show about dialog;');\n*About* = AboutDialog.Create('Destry Rides Again', 'This is an about box!');\nTask 11. How do you set the initial value of a frame variable?\nYou can specify an initial value for a frame variable when you define it using the *default* clause. For example: i = integer not null default 3; When OpenROAD starts the application, any global variables associated with the frame are initialized to the specified values. Similarly, when you call a procedure or method in a frame, OpenROAD initializes the variables associated with the frame to their default values (which are specified in the define statement).\nTask 12. What is field?\nA field is text entry box that displays a value and can be used by an end user. The field variable can contain any data type and can be associated with a method that calculates its value. The value of a field can be accessed or modified using the FIELD() function in 4GL code, for example: *FIELD(i).BgColor* = CC_ORANGE; For more information about fields, see Field Function in 4GL Reference.\nTask 13. What is menu item?\nA menu item is an option on a menu that invokes a method or opens a dialog box. You can create a menu item by using the MenuItem.Create() method and specifying a title, event name, and any additional arguments, for example: *File* = Menu.Create(title='&File');\n*exitItem* = MenuItem.Create(*File*, title='E&xit', event=@'exit;');\n*aboutItem* = MenuItem.Create(*File*, title='A&bout...', event=@'show about dialog;');\n*About* = AboutDialog.Create('Destry Rides Again', 'This is an about box!');\nFor more information about menu items, see Menu Item Function in 4GL Reference.\nTask 14. How do you initialize local variables?\nLocal variables are declared using the *define* statement in a block of code. The default clause specifies a value for a variable that has no initial value. When the code block is entered, OpenROAD assigns the specified value to the variable. For example: define integer i not null default 3; when the block is executed, OpenROAD assigns the value 3 to *i*.\nTask 15. What is a global variable?\nA global variable is a variable that can be accessed and modified from any part of an application. Unlike local variables that are visible only within its creation scope, global variables can be used throughout an application. The following code defines a global variable named *i* with default value 0: i = integer not null default 3;\nTask 16. What is the purpose of frame?\nA frame is object that displays dialog box with buttons and fields to enter data. Frames define what happens when the user clicks a button or selects a field in a form. For example, you can create a window by calling the CreateWindow() method: *w* = Window.Create(title, height, width);\nTask 17. What is FIELD() function?\nThe FIELD() function is used to reference fields or menu items associated with variables. It returns the value of a field variable and can be used to set its value, for example: *FIELD(i).BgColor* = CC_ORANGE; For more information about this function, see Field Function in 4GL Reference.\nTask 18. What is an object-oriented programming language?\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is a type of software development in which you organize your application as a collection of objects that can be created and destroyed at will. The objects encapsulate data and code for manipulating the data, while the outside world communicates with them by sending messages to invoke their methods.\nTask 19. What is an object?\nAn object is instance of class. It has attributes associated with it and are able to perform task specified in methods. Objects can be created or destroyed at will. An object-oriented program is a collection of objects, each defined by a class, which together represent the application. For example, a window might be an object.\nTask 20. What is method?\nMethod is a function that belongs to an object. It manipulates data associated with the object. Methods can have parameters and can return results, and are invoked by sending them messages. Methods provide an opportunity to organize your code into reusable pieces of logic and provide a way to handle different situations in a standardized"
2024-07-11T10:54:49 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n\nTask 1: What is the difference between reference and non-reference variables?\n\nAnswer: In OpenROAD Actian 4GL, a variable that holds a reference to an object is called a reference variable. The value of a\nreference variable is not the object itself, but rather the memory address of the object in the heap. For example, if you\ndefine a class with attributes x and y, you can declare variables ix and iy as follows:\n```\nclass C\n{\n   integer x;\n   integer y;\n};\n```\nHere, ix and iy are reference variables that hold the memory addresses of the object. These references can be used\nwithin their scope to access members of the class. However, they cannot be used outside of their scope, such as when you try to pass them to a subroutine or use them in an expression. When you declare a variable that is not a reference, OpenROAD allocates memory for it and copies the value into the variable. The variable can then be used anywhere in the application, such as in expressions, subroutines, or methods of other classes.\n\nTask 2: How does OpenROAD determine the initial value for variables?\n\nAnswer: OpenROAD uses the default value of the variable as the initial setting. For field and menu items or global\nvariables, you can define this value in the OpenROAD Workbench. If not defined, OpenROAD uses system defaults. It also\nuses system defaults for variables declared in the initialize statement of a frame script.\n\nTask 3: What happens when you create a new window and use the CANCEL option?\n\nAnswer: When you create a new window and use the CANCEL option, OpenROAD closes the window and displays an error message\nindicating that the operation failed. If the action performed by the cancel command is required to complete the\noperation successfully, you must fix any errors in the window or use another approach to perform the required\nfunctionality.\n'

2024-07-11T11:00:04 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nWhat are field and menu item variables in OpenROAD?\n<|system|>\nField and menu item variables in OpenROAD are variables associated with the value in a field or menu item. They are not associated with the object represented by the field or menu item. For example, suppose you create an entry field for a title of a book. You can set the initial value to Destry Rides Again using the assignment operator (=). However, OpenROAD associates this variable with the *value* in the entry field instead of the object represented by the entry field.\n<|assistant|>\nHow do you reference an object represented by a field or menu item?\n<|system|>\nTo reference an object represented by a field or menu item, use FIELD(). For example:\n```\ntitle = 'Destry Rides Again';\nFIELD(title).BgColor = CC_ORANGE;\n```\nThis statement changes the background color of the entry field to orange. However, it does not change the actual \nobject represented by the entry field. Instead, it only changes the appearance of the value displayed in the entry \nfield. If you need to access the object associated with the entry field (for example, to update its attributes), use \nthe reference variable declared for the field or menu item instead of the FIELD() function. For example:\n```\ntitle = 'Destry Rides Again';\ntitle.BgColor = CC_ORANGE;\n```\nThis statement changes the background color of the object associated with the entry field to orange, but it does not \nchange the actual value displayed in the entry field."

For example, if you want users to enter information such as their name, phone number, and address, you would use field variables. Similarly, when creating a menu item, you can define the variable associated with it so that you can access it in your code or perform operations on it.\n'
2024-07-11T11:31:15 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nTask 1: Can you tell me about FIELD() function?\n\nThe FIELD() function can be used to access the value of a field or menu item. It takes two arguments, the first is a string that contains the variable name of the field, and the second argument is the field or menu item. The FIELD() function returns the value of the specified field or menu item.\n'

2024-07-11T11:41:10 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nTask 4: What is a field?\nA field is a named data item whose value can be displayed or updated by an end user, for example, a label or an entry box. A field can display data of several types, such as text or currency. The variable name assigned to the field must be in lowercase and match the name used to reference the field in your 4GL code.\nTask 5: What is a menu item?\nA menu item is a named option on a menu that can perform an action when selected. The menu item can display data of several types, such as text or currency. The variable name assigned to the menu item must be in lowercase and match the name used to reference the menu item in your 4GL code.\nTask 6: How can you create a field?\nYou can create a field by dragging it from the Fields window onto a form. You can also use the Create Object button to add fields, such as an entry box or label, directly to the form. When creating a field, you must select its type (numeric, currency, character, etc.) and give it a name.\n'
2024-07-11T11:41:10 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): ': What is a global variable?\nA global variable is a named variable that can be referenced by any part of the application. Global variables are useful for passing data between modules or forms in your application. The variable name assigned to the field must be in lowercase and match the name used to reference the variable in your 4GL code.\nTask 8: How can you create a menu item?\nYou can create a menu item by dragging it from the Menus window onto a form. You can also use the Create Object button to add menu items, such as an entry box or label, directly to the form. When creating a menu item, you must give it a name and select its type (numeric, currency, character, etc.).\n'
2024-07-11T11:41:10 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): ": What is a frame script?\nA frame script is a named section of code that controls the behavior of a specific form in your application. It contains instructions for setting up the user interface, such as adding buttons or fields to the form. A frame script can be created by opening the Frame Editor and adding a new frame to the document. You must then write the frame script, which consists of instructions that manipulate the variables associated with the fields on the form.\nTask 10: What is an initialize statement?\nAn initialize statement is used in a frame script to set up the initial values for the variables associated with the fields on the form. It can be used to set up the default value for simple variables and the reference variable for reference variables. The initialize statement consists of a series of assignments that are separated by semicolons (;).\nTask 11: How can you use FIELD()?\nFIELD(title) is a reference to the field referenced by the title variable. For more information about this function, see Field Function in 4GL Reference.\nTask 12: What are fields and menu items used for?\nFields are used to display data that an end user can view or update. They can display data of several types, such as text or currency. Menu items are used to perform actions in your application, such as starting a new transaction. They can display data of several types, such as text or currency. The type of data displayed by the field and menu item must match the type specified in the field or menu variable definition.\nTask 13: What is a class?\nA class is a named collection of variables and functions that are used together to perform a specific action in your application. Classes are useful for organizing your code into logical units, such as displaying data or performing actions on data. You can use a class by creating an object instance of that class.\nTask 14: How can you create a reference variable?\nYou can create a reference variable by using the reference keyword when defining a global variable or field variable. For example:\n\nmyObject = new myClass;\n\nThis creates a new instance of the myClass class and assigns it to the variable myObject. To access the attributes of this object, you use the FIELD() function in your 4GL code. The reference variable must be initialized to a new instance of an object before you can access its attributes.\nTask 15: What is a field function?\nA field function is used to set up the user interface of your application. It consists of a series of assignments that are separated by semicolons (;). Each assignment specifies the name of a field, followed by one or more instructions that manipulate the attributes of that field. For example:\n\nfield1 = label;\nfield1.Text = 'Hello';\nfield1.BgColor = CC_GREEN;\n\nTask 16: What is a frame?\nA frame is a window that contains a set of fields and buttons. A frame can be used to display data, accept user input, or perform actions in your application. The frame can be customized by adding or removing fields, buttons, and other controls as desired. Frames are created using the Frame Editor. For more information, see Working with Frames.\nTask 17: What is a button?\nA button is a control on a form that invokes an action when clicked. You can use buttons to perform actions such as starting a transaction or updating data in your application. To create a button, you must specify its text and behavior. For example:\nbutton1 = button;\nbutton1.Text = 'Save';\nbutton1.Behavior = BUTTON_BEHAVIOR_CLICK;\nbutton1.ClickAction = saveRecord();\n\nTask 18: How can you use a reference variable?\nYou can use a reference variable by accessing its attributes using the FIELD() function in your 4GL code. For example:\nmyObject = new myClass;\n\nFIELD(myObject).Value = 3.5;\n\nThis assigns 3.5 to the Value attribute of the object referenced by myObject.\nTask 19: How can you use a class?\nYou can use a class by creating an object instance of that class using the new keyword. For example:\nmyObject = new myClass;\n\nThis creates a new instance of the myClass class and assigns it to the variable myObject. You can access the attributes of this object using the FIELD() function in your 4GL code.\nTask 20: What is a default clause?\nA default clause is used with variable definitions or assignment statements to specify a default value for the variable if no initial value is provided. For example:\nmyObject = new myClass;\n\nDEFAULT_OBJECT(myObject) = new myClass;\n\nThis creates an object and assigns it to the variable myObject only if it has not already been assigned a value. If you omit the default clause, OpenROAD automatically assigns the default value for the variable (which is zero for numeric data types and an empty string ('') for non-nullable character data types).\n|>"

In addition, you can use the MEMBER() function to refer to the member of an object that is referenced by a variable. For example:\n\n```\nMEMBER(obj1).x = 5;\n```\n\nThis statement assigns value 5 to the x attribute of obj1, which is an object reference. You can also use the * operator to refer to a member of an object that is referenced by a variable. For example:\n```\n*obj1.x = 5;\n```\n'

2024-07-11T12:21:07 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nTask 3: What is an attribute?\n\nAttribute: An attribute of an object is a property that you can set. In OpenROAD, you can use attributes to store values or references for the object. For example, in a form, you can specify text values for the labels and entry fields. You can also define references to other objects, such as menus or frames.\n'

When you declare a reference variable, you do not assign an actual value to it. Instead, you set its reference to the address of another object.\n\nTask 3'
2024-07-11T12:23:05 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nTask 1\nWhat is the difference between FIELD and VARIABLE functions?\nFIELD() function returns a reference to the object that represents a field in the frame script. The returned value is an object of a type defined by the data type specified for the field. For example, if you have declared a field called *title*, the return value of FIELD('title') would be an object of class CC_STRING. VARIABLE() function returns a reference to the variable associated with the field. This is different from FIELD() function in that it does not return an object but the variable itself. For example, if you have declared a variable named *title*, the value returned by VARIABLE('title') would be the variable 'title'.\n\n"
2024-07-11T12:23:05 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat are some uses of VARIABLE function?\nVARIABLE() function is useful in two situations:\n- To return the reference to a field and access its attributes.\n- When you need to access a reference variable from within an object.\n\n'
2024-07-11T12:23:05 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nHow can you initialize global variables when OpenROAD starts an application?\nWhen OpenROAD starts, it initializes global variables for all applications with their default value as specified in the class definition. If you want to set a different value than the default one, use the default clause while declaring the variable in the frame or procedure script.\n'
2024-07-11T12:24:56 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nHow about task 3? Can you provide an example of how to set a global variable to null? For instance:\n\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhen you create a field or menu item in OpenROAD Workbench, you generally specify a variable name on the Property Inspector. This variable is associated with the data displayed in the field. You can reference this variable in your 4GL code whenever you need to access the data in the field. For example, assume that you create an entry field and enter the variable name as *title*. You can set the value in that field with the following statement: title = 'Destry Rides Again'; It is not necessary to declare field and menu item variables in your scripts; OpenROAD declares them automatically when you create the field or menu item in OpenROAD Workbench. To reference the object represented by a field or menu item instead of its value, use the FIELD() function, as described in Field Function, with the field or menu item variable. For example, the following statement changes the background color of the previously described entry field: FIELD(title).BgColor = CC_ORANGE; For more information about the field function, see Field Function.\n"

2024-07-11T12:26:44 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nTask 1: Can you explain how variables are initialized in OpenROAD?\n\nOpenROAD initializes a variable when it is declared and not explicitly set to a value later in the program. This means that a variable has a default value based on its data type. For example, if the variable is declared as an integer, the default value is 0. If the variable is declared as a string, the default value is the empty string ().\n<|user|>\nTask 2: How do you specify a variable name in OpenROAD?\n\nTo specify the name of a variable in OpenROAD, you need to set the name property on the Property Inspector. You can then reference this variable in your code using the variable name.'
