The statement has the following syntax:\n\n[returnvariable =] callproc procname[(parameterlist)];\nYou can call this procedure from a frame, a procedure, or a method for a user class. Because `procname` is a dynamic name, you can use an actual procedure name or a variable that resolves to a procedure name at runtime. If you use an actual procedure name, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time. If you use a variable, OpenROAD resolves the procedure reference at runtime. This difference in the timing of name resolution has an important consequence when the callproc statement is executed inside an included application.\n\nTo pass values to the called procedure, use the optional parameter list in the callproc statement. You can pass the parameters by value or by reference. To pass values by reference to a 4GL or 3GL procedure, use the `byref(variable)` option.\n\nFor more information about using the callproc statement to pass parameters by value and by reference, see the *Programming Guide*.\n<|system|>\nAn Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement is used to call a procedure from a frame, a procedure, or a method for a user class.

Suppose we have two procedures addtax and calculateprice in the same frame as below:\n```\nbeginframe\ncallproc addtax(tax = taxpercent, total = byref(price));\ncallproc calculateprice(taxed = price, discount = byref(discount), total = byref(price2));\nendframe;\n```\nHere we have two procedures in the same frame. The first procedure is called addtax and it adds a tax to a variable called price. The second procedure is called calculateprice and it calculates the total price after applying a discount on top of the added tax. This is where we need to return the updated value of `price` back to the calling frame or procedure. We can do this by using the returnvariable parameter in both procedures.\n\n```\ncallproc addtax(tax = taxpercent, total = byref(price));\n```\nIn this statement, we specify the returnvariable as 'price'. So after executing the addtax procedure, the `price` variable in calling frame or procedure will have its new value set to the updated price after adding the tax.\n\n```\ncallproc calculateprice(taxed = price, discount = byref(discount), total = byref(price2));\n```\nIn this statement, we specify returnvariable as 'price2' and we are passing the `price` variable which has just been updated in addtax procedure. So now this value of price is passed to calculateprice procedure and it calculates the new total after applying a discount. After that the final result is returned back to calling frame or procedure as the updated price value.\n"

2024-07-11T12:34:09 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n\n## Callproc Statement\n\nThis statement calls a procedure from a frame, a procedure, or a method for a user class. The callproc statement calls any of these types of procedures:\n- A global or local procedure written in 4GL\n- A procedure written in another high-level programming language (a 3GL language such as C or FORTRAN)\n\nNote: To call a database procedure, use the Execute Procedure Statement.\n\nThis statement has the following syntax:\n`[returnvariable =] callproc procname[(parameterlist)];`\n\nYou can call this procedure from a frame, a procedure, or a method for a user class. Because `procname` is a dynamic name, you can use an actual procedure name or a variable that resolves to a procedure name at runtime. If you use an actual procedure name, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time. If you use a variable, OpenROAD resolves the procedure reference at runtime. This difference in the timing of name resolution has an important consequence when the callproc statement is executed inside an included application.\n\nTo pass values to the called procedure, use the optional parameter list in the callproc statement. You can pass the parameters by value or by reference. To pass values by reference to a 4GL or 3GL procedure, use the `byref(variable)` option.\n\nFor more information about using the callproc statement to pass parameters by value and by reference, see the Programming Guide.\n\nOn returning from the called procedure, you can pass a single value back to the calling procedure or frame. The data type of the variable that receives the return value must be compatible with the return type of the called procedure. For database procedures, the return type is always integer.\n\nIf you use a variable to represent the procedure name so that the user can specify a procedure at runtime, you must ensure that the data type of the procedure's return value is compatible with that of any specified return variable. OpenROAD assumes that the return value's data type is the same as the return variable type. If the procedure attempts to return a value of an incompatible type, an error results at runtime.\n\nNote: You can also call a procedure as part of an expression. When you do so, the callproc keyword is not needed.\n\n### Parameters--Callproc Statement\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n#### returnvariable\nSpecifies the name of the variable in the calling frame or procedure that receives the return value from the called procedure. Its data type must agree with the return type of the called procedure.\n\n#### procname\nSpecifies the name of the procedure you are calling. You must enclose any procedure name that is the same as a 4GL keyword in single quotes. The procedure name you use for `procname` must match the name in the procedure's definition.\n\n#### parameterlist\nFor 4GL procedures, see NamedParameterList. For 3GL procedures, see UnnamedParameterList.\n\n### Example--Callproc Statement\nCall the OpenROAD procedure, addtax, passing the `taxpercent` variable by value and the `price` variable by reference:\n`callproc addtax(tax = taxpercent, total = byref(price));`\nBecause `price` is passed by reference, the procedure can update its value by adding the tax amount. The new total price is visible to the calling frame or procedure after the addtax procedure returns.\n\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n"

Instruction:\nHow can you pass parameters by reference?\nInput:\nYes, can you tell me how to pass a parameter by value?\nOutput:\nTo pass a parameter by value, simply include its name and the value within parentheses in the callproc statement. Do not use any option or specify a default value. For example, if the procedure definition has `x int` as input, pass x as an integer value without specifying an option:\ncallproc procname(x = 123);\n2. Instruction:\nHow does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement handle procedure name resolution?\nInput:\n<noinput>\nOutput:\nIf an actual procedure name is used, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time.

Instruction:\nHow do you pass parameters to a database procedure in a callproc statement?\nInput:\nI'm using a callproc statement and I don't know how to pass parameters to a database procedure. Can you tell me how?\nOutput:\nYou can pass parameters to a database procedure in a callproc statement by using the `byref(variable)` option in the callproc statement. This instructs the OpenROAD system to return values by reference to the database server rather than by value from the client application. For example, if you want to call the database stored procedure `sp_AddTax`, you would write:\ncallproc sp_AddTax(taxpercent = tax, total = byref(price));\nThe parameter list for this example passes parameters to the stored procedure by reference so that changes made by the database procedure can be returned to the application."

2024-07-11T13:33:56 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nCan you explain the difference between passing a parameter by reference and passing it by value in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?\n\n\n** Input\nI understand that we can pass a parameter to a procedure in two ways: By Value or By Reference. What are these called in OpenROAD Actian 4GL? Can you explain the difference between them?\n** Output\nIn OpenROAD Actian 4GL, you can pass parameters to procedures in two ways: by value and by reference. Passing a parameter by value means that the procedure receives its actual value from the calling frame or procedure. Passing a parameter by reference means that the procedure receives an address that points to a variable in the calling frame or procedure. The actual data is not copied; instead, the procedure accesses the original variable.\nWhen you pass a parameter by value, the called procedure cannot change its value unless it passes the parameter back to the caller through the return statement or through a reference argument. When you pass a parameter by reference, the called procedure can change its value and the new value is immediately visible in the calling frame or procedure. This is because the parameter is passed as an address, which points directly to the data. The called procedure does not need to return any values; instead, it modifies the variable directly and returns control back to the caller.\nThe advantage of passing by value is that the procedure cannot change its value without returning it through the return statement or a reference argument. This ensures that the calling frame or procedure retains control over the data and does not depend on the called procedure for its own data integrity. The advantage of passing by reference is that the called procedure can directly modify any values in the calling frame or procedure, so there is no need to return the results through a return statement. However, this approach also requires more care because the called procedure cannot prevent the caller from changing the variables it uses.\n'

In contrast, UnNamedParameterList refers to the list of values used in an Execute Statement when executing a query. You can provide any type of input values as long as they are compatible with the data types specified in the parameter definition of the procedure being called.\nTask 2\nHow should procedure names that are the same as 4GL keywords be handled in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Callproc Statement?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nProcedure names that are the same as 4GL keywords must be enclosed in single quotes.\nTask 3\nWhat is the return value of a callproc statement and how should it be declared in the calling frame or procedure?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe data type of the variable that receives the return value from the called procedure must agree with the return type of the called procedure. If you use an actual procedure name, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time. If you use a variable, OpenROAD resolves the procedure reference at runtime. This difference in the timing of name resolution has an important consequence when the callproc statement is executed inside an included application.\nTask 4\nHow do you call a procedure as part of an expression and what are the implications?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhen you do so, the callproc keyword is not needed.

For example, when using OpenROAD with an SQL database, use NamedParameterList for `ExecSQL` statements because the procedure accepts input parameters.\n- Use UnnamedParameterList only when calling a FORTRAN procedure. The FORTRAN language requires positional arguments passed by value and does not allow named parameters.

The new total price is visible to the calling frame or procedure after the addtax procedure returns.\n\n### Example--Callproc Statement with Dynamic Procedure Name\n\nIn this example, `procname` resolves dynamically at runtime, so it must be enclosed in single quotes. When called from a method, you can use an actual procedure name instead of a string literal:\n```\nstring procname;\nprocname = 'addtax';\ncallproc procname(tax = taxpercent, total = byref(price));\n```\nYou can also pass dynamic procedure names to methods and frames for user-defined procedures. For more information, see *Executing User Procedures* in the *Programming Guide*.\n\n### Example--Callproc Statement with Multiple Return Variables\n\nWhen a called procedure returns multiple values, you must use an array or structure variable to hold these return values in your caller's frame. You can specify more than one return variable by listing them within parentheses:\n```\ndeclare procedure addtax(\n  tax percent%,\n  price integer,\n  total integer output;\n\ncallproc addtax(tax = taxpercent, total = byref(price), discount amount);\ndiscount := discount_calc(price, discount);\n```\nIn this example, the `addtax` procedure returns two values: the new price and a calculated discount. To receive these values, you must create an array or structure variable to hold them, and then list them in parentheses when calling the addtax procedure.\n\nYou can use any data type for the return variable that matches the type of the parameter's return value in the called procedure. However, if the called procedure returns more values than you specify in the callproc statement, OpenROAD treats the additional return values as zero or null values, and does not pass them back to the calling frame or procedure."
