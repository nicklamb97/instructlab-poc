We want to check if an employee\'s salary is greater than $50,000.\n**Output**\nTo achieve this, you can use the following code:\n```\nif salary > 50000 then\n    print \'Employee earns more than $50,000\';\nelse\n    print \'Employee earns less or equal to $50,000\';\nendif;\n```\n2. **Instruction**\nWhat is the correct syntax for an if-then statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD If Then Else Statement?\n**Input**\n<noinput>\n**Output**\nThe correct syntax for an if-then statement is as follows:\n```\nif condition then\n    action;\nendif;\n```\nFor example, to check if a variable "x" is greater than 10 and perform an action if true:\n```\nif x > 10 then\n    print \'Value of x is greater than 10\';\nendif;\n```\n3. **Instruction**\nHow can you use the elseif clause in Actian 4GL OpenROAD If Then Else Statement to handle multiple conditions?\n**Input**\nSuppose we have a table "orders" with columns "status", "date", and "amount". We want to check if an order\'s status is either "shipped" or "delivered" within the last two days, regardless of the amount.\n**Output**\nTo achieve this, you can use the following code:\n```\nif date - today <= 2 then\n    if status = \'shipped\' or status = \'delivered\' then\n        print \'Order shipped or delivered recently\';\n    endif;\nelse\n    print \'Order not shipped or delivered recently\';\nendif;\n```\n4. **Instruction**\nHow to use the else clause in Actian 4GL OpenROAD If Then Else Statement to specify a default action?\n**Input**\nSuppose we have a table "weather" with columns "city", "temperature", and "condition". We want to print a message if the temperature is above or below average.\n**Output**\nTo achieve this, you can use the following code:\n```\nif temperature > 20 then\n    print \'Temperature is hot\';\nelseif temperature < 10 then\n    print \'Temperature is cold\';\nelse\n    print \'Temperature is average\';\nendif;\n```\n5. **Instruction**\nWhat is the purpose of using the endif statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD If Then Else Statement?\n**Input**\n<noinput>\n**Output**\nThe endlif statement marks the end of the if-then-else structure and ensures that the code executes the corresponding action only once the condition has been evaluated. It provides a clear indication of where the conditional block ends, making the code more readable and maintainable.'
