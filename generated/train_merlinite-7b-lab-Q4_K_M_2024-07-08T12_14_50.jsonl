The three abstract data types discussed in the document are:\n1. Money data type: Represents monetary values with two decimal places. It can be specified as a character string literal or a number, and is rounded to dollars and cents on input and output. Money variables can accommodate a range of -999,999,999,999.99 to 999,999,999,999.99.\n2. Numeric string data type: A virtual type that exists when numeric and character data types are compared directly. If a comparison is requested between these two classes of data, the character data is examined to see if it is numeric in form. If it is, then the comparison is performed as though both were numeric.\n3. Logical key data type: Allows the DBMS Server or your application to assign a unique key value to each row in a table. Logical keys are useful when an application requires a table to have a unique key, and the columns of the table do not comprise a unique key. There are two types of logical keys: system-maintained and not system-maintained. Specify the scope of uniqueness for system-maintained logical key columns using TABLE\\_KEY or OBJECT\\_KEY options.\n\nPlease note that this response is based on the provided document, which focuses on abstract data types in the OpenROAD programming language. The examples and restrictions shown in the task instructions are not included in this response because they do not correspond to the information given in the document."}

For instance, money data types are stored with significant precision to two decimal places and retain this precision when performing arithmetic operations. Numeric string data types are checked for numeric content during compatibility checks and help ensure accurate comparisons. Logical key data types allow the assignment of unique keys to each row in a table, providing another level of consistency and integrity. By understanding these characteristics, developers can optimize their code and prevent potential issues down the line."}

The data types considered as numeric are all the integer types, all the float types, and decimal. Money is not treated in this manner because it has its own character data compatibility. To be deemed numeric, a character data value must contain only one number, which can be in integer, decimal, float, or scientific notation form."}
