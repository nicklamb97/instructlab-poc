You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What are some different types of conditional statements that can be used in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?", "assistant": "There are several types of conditional statements that you can use to control the flow of your application. Some of these statements include:\n1. If-Then-Else Statement: This is the simplest form of a conditional statement and executes a group of statements if a condition is met, otherwise, it executes another set of statements. The else part can be omitted.\n2. ElseIf Statement: This is similar to the If-Then-Else statement but allows you to have multiple conditions for which different sets of statements will execute.\n3. Switch Case Statement: This is a more sophisticated conditional statement that works on a set of values instead of a single condition. It compares the value against a set of cases and executes a group of statements that corresponds to the case that matches the value.\n4. While Loop Statement: This is a statement that executes while a certain condition is true, otherwise it continues until a break statement is reached.\n5. Do-While Loop Statement: Similar to the while loop but instead of starting with the conditional check at the beginning, this statement starts executing the statements and then checks the condition at the end.\n6. For-Loop Statement: This statement allows you to repeat a group of statements while increasing a variable by a constant value or decreasing a variable by a constant value.\n7. Until Loop Statement: Similar to the while loop but instead of starting with the conditional check at the beginning, this statement starts executing the statements and then checks the condition at the end."}
