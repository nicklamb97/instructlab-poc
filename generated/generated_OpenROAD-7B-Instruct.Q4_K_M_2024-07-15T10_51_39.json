        "output": "You can execute any procedure or function in two different ways: by invoking it directly with its name, or using one of many predefined calls. The first method involves specifying a reference to the object that owns the procedure or function, followed by an opening parenthesis and closing bracket around its name. This calls the specified code within your application and returns any results it produces. The second approach allows you to use any of dozens of built-in functions which perform various tasks, including calling other procedures and modifying data in memory. For example:\n```4gl\nadd(3, 5);\n```\nThis statement adds two integers (3 and 5) together and returns the result as a floating point number. You can also use this function to perform calculations on complex values, such as strings or dates. The following example demonstrates how you might use it:\n```4gl\nconcatenate('Hello ', name);\n```\nThis statement combines two strings ('Hello' and the value of the 'name' variable) into one and returns it as a new string object. You can access individual characters within this string using their index numbers. For example:\n```4gl\nlength(colors);\n```\nThis statement determines the number of elements in the 'colors' array and returns it as an integer. You can also use this function to perform comparisons between different types of values, such as integers and strings. The following example demonstrates how you might use it:\n```4gl\nif (age > 18) then do something;\n```\nThis statement checks whether the 'age' variable holds a value greater than 18, and if so, executes any code you specify within its opening parenthesis and closing bracket. The condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false, including comparisons between different types of values. For example:\n```4gl\nif (colors[0] is not null) then do something;\n```\nThis statement checks whether the first element in the 'colors' array has a non-null value, and if so, executes any code you specify within its opening parenthesis and closing bracket.

For example, using numeric types for numbers and string types for text values. This helps avoid issues like trying to add two strings together or storing invalid characters in a field.\n- Following proper naming conventions when defining your objects and their properties. This makes it easier for others to understand your code and reduces the likelihood of typos or ambiguity in variable names.\n- Making use of defaults whenever possible. Default values are set automatically when you create an object or define its attributes. They save time and reduce errors by not having to specify every detail for simple properties like color or size.",

The constructor initializes the fields of the new instance with their default values, and the destructor cleans up after deleting the object from memory. You can also pass arguments to constructors and destructors using parentheses (). For example:\n```4gl\nnew Car(make = 'Ford', model = 'Mustang', year = 1969);\n```\nHere we create a new instance of the 'Car' class with its make field set to 'Ford', its model field set to 'Mustang', and its year field set to 1969. Now Actian 4GL initializes all the fields in this new car with their default values (in this case, we used 'null' as our default value for strings). Once we have created the car, we can use it in our code by referencing its properties or methods. In this example, we set the make property to 'Ford', the model property to 'Mustang', and the year property to 1969.\nYou can also destroy objects when you no longer need them. For example, you might use destructors to free up memory after an object has served its purpose in your code or when you want to remove it from a container (such as a list or array). In this case, Actian 4GL deletes the object from memory and frees up any resources it was using.",

When you call this function, Actian 4GL executes its code and adds the values of the two integers passed in as arguments. The function then returns the resulting sum (in this case, we used 'int' for our return type). You can also specify any other type of data you want when defining your functions. For example:\n```4gl\nfunction greet(name) {\n    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n}\n```\nHere we declare a function named 'greet' that takes one string parameter ('name').

The loop initializes its variable(s) with their default values, and then continues executing the block of code until it reaches its condition (which you specify when declaring the loop). Once the loop finishes executing the block of code, Actian 4GL destroys the variables it created for the loop and cleans up after deleting them from memory. For example:\n```4gl\nfor (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n    console.log(`The value of i is ${i}`);\n}\n```\nHere we create a new integer variable named 'i' and then set its initial value to 0.

In each iteration of the loop, it logs a message to the console that includes the current value of variable 'i' (in this case, we used '{i}' as our message format). Once the loop finishes executing its 10th iteration, Actian 4GL destroys the integer variable it created for the loop and cleans up after deleting it from memory.\nYou can also use loops to iterate over collections (such as arrays or lists). For example, you might use a 'for-in' loop to go through each element in an array and perform some operation on it. In this case, Actian 4GL initializes the variable you specified when declaring the loop with its first element from the collection (in this case, we used 'int' for our return type).

        "output": "To create a new menu item, follow these steps:\n1. Declare an enumeration for your menu item:\n```4gl\nenum myMenuItem;\n```\nWhere 'myMenuItem' is the name of your enumeration. This will create an enumeration with three possible values: 'None', 'myMenuItem1', and 'myMenuItem2'. You can now use this enumeration as a variable type in your code. For example:\n```4gl\nmyMenuItem = 'myMenuItem1';\n```\nHere we set the enumeration 'myMenuItem' to the value 'myMenuItem1'. Now you can use this enumeration in your code like this:\n```4gl\nmyMenuItem.caption = 'New Item';\n```\nThis statement sets the caption property of the enumeration 'myMenuItem' to 'New Item'. The caption property determines how Actian 4GL displays your menu item on the menu bar or in a popup menu.\n2. Create your new menu item with the desired properties:\n```4gl\nmenu_item myMenuItem = new(caption='New Item', shortcut=ControlKey+M);\n```\nWhere 'myMenuItem' is the name of your menu item. This creates a new menu item with the specified caption and shortcut key. Now you can add this menu item to any menu or popup menu using its reference variable. For example:\n```4gl\nmenu_item.add_to_menu(myMenu);\n```\nHere we add our newly created 'myMenuItem' to the 'myMenu' menu. We also specify a shortcut key for it so users can quickly access it with their keyboard.\n3. Use your new menu item in your code:\n```4gl\nmyMenuItem.invoke();\n```\nThis statement invokes the previously created 'myMenuItem'. It displays a popup menu containing all of its properties, such as its caption and shortcut key. You can now interact with this menu item like any other object in your application. For example:\n```4gl\nmyMenuItem.captions = ['New Item', 'Open Document'];\n```\nHere we set the captions property of our menu item to contain two entries: 'New Item' and 'Open Document'.

        "instruction": "What are the rules for using variables in Actian 4GL? **",
        "input": "",
        "output": "You must follow these rules when declaring and using variables in Actian 4GL:\n1. A variable's name cannot be a keyword or reserved word. For example, you cannot use the names 'if', 'else', or 'while' as variable names (in this case, we used '{variable}' for our message format).\n2. When you declare a variable, you must specify its type. The type of variable determines what values it can hold (in this case, we used 'integer' for our return type). For example, when declaring an integer variable, you must set its initial value to some valid integer number between -32768 and 32767 (in this case, we used 'int' for our message format).\n3. When you use a variable in your code, Actian 4GL checks it for invalid values. If the variable contains an invalid value, Actian 4GL raises an error and terminates the execution of your code (in this case, we used '{variable}' as our message format). For example, if you try to divide an integer by zero, Actian 4GL will throw a 'divide by zero' error and terminate the execution of your code.\n4. When you initialize a variable, you can use any valid value as its initial value. However, when setting the initial value of a variable, you must use a valid number or 'null'. For example, when creating an integer variable, you can set its initial value to any valid integer number between -32768 and 32767 (in this case, we used 'int' for our return type). In this case, Actian 4GL creates the variable and stores it in your specified name (in this case, we used '{integer}' as our message format). Once the variable is initialized, you can now access all of its attributes or methods using that variable as a handle.\n5. When you reference a variable in your code, Actian 4GL looks up its value from memory. If the variable does not exist in memory, Actian 4GL raises an error and terminates the execution of your code (in this case, we used '{variable}' as our message format). For example, when you try to access the properties of an object, Actian 4GL first looks up its class in memory (in this case, we used 'object' for our return type). Once Actian 4GL finds the class, it then opens it and reads all of its attributes into memory. Now you can now access all of those attributes or methods using that variable as a handle.\n6. When you destroy a variable, Actian 4GL removes it from memory and cleans up after deleting it. For example, when you no longer need an integer variable, you can simply destroy it with the 'destroy' statement (in this case, we used 'integer' for our return type). Now Actian 4GL destroys the variable and cleans up after deleting it from memory.\n7. When you declare a constant, you must specify its value. The value of the constant cannot change throughout the execution of your code (in this case, we used 'constant' for our return type). For example, when declaring an integer constant, you must set its initial value to some valid integer number between -32768 and 32767 (in this case, we used 'int' for our message format). Once the constant is declared, Actian 4GL creates it in memory and stores it with its specified value. Now you can now use that constant throughout your code as a handle.",

After creating the array, you can access its elements using index notation:\n```4gl\nmyarray[1] = 3;\n```\nThis statement sets the second element of 'myarray' to 3. You can also use array literals when defining variables or passing them as arguments:\n```4gl\ncreate table mytable (\n    id integer not null,\n    name varchar(25) not null,\n    address varchar(100) not null,\n    phone numeric(10) not null,\n);\n```\nThis statement creates a new table called 'mytable' that has four columns: id (an integer primary key), name (a variable length string), address (a variable length string), and phone (a numeric data type). The table also defines its constraints, such as not allowing null values in any of its columns. After creating the table, you can insert rows into it using the `insert into` statement:\n```4gl\ninsert into mytable (\n    id, name, address, phone\n) values (\n    1, 'John Doe', '123 Main Street', '555-1234'\n);\n```\nThis statement inserts a new row into the 'mytable' table with the following fields: id = 1, name = 'John Doe', address = '123 Main Street', and phone = 555-1234. The values you provide for each field must match the data types of their corresponding columns in the table.
