2024-07-11T08:56:48 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat is the purpose of the dbmsinfo() function in OpenROAD?\n\n<|user|>\nThe dbmsinfo() function returns a string that contains information about the database manager you are connected to, such as the version number or the name of the DBMS. The dbmsinfo() function is used by Ingres programmers who need to test compatibility with other systems. OpenROAD provides a version number in the SYSTEM command response, but not all other parameters are available in this form.\n\n'

The SYSTEM command returns information such as the client host name and version number. However, OpenROAD cannot return information about the database server on which you are connected, so this would be an example of a task that can only be completed in Ingres programming.\n'

They enable you to access database tables, perform operations on columns, and write information to the output file. For example, use :lv_searchString to retrieve the value in the variable lv_searchString from the database table or a local array. Use the @ operator to dereference an array pointer, such as @myArrayPtr[1] to get the second element in the array pointed to by myArrayPtr.\n'

These operations include sum, min, max, average, and count. For these operations to work correctly, OpenROAD needs the input data to be organized in a specific manner called an "array."\n\nScalar functions are used to perform individual operations on a single value. Examples of scalar function include: abs(), floor(), round(), ceil() and so on. The output from these functions is always a single value.\nAggregate functions take an array as input, perform their operation and return the result. The output from aggregate functions can be a single value (for example count()) or multiple values (for example min( ), max(), average()).\nFor more information, see Aggregate Functions in OpenROAD Programming Language.'

The reason OpenROAD cannot process these functions locally is that they require access to the underlying database management system (DBMS), and are therefore implemented in SQL. Because the dbmsinfo() function retrieves information about the DBMS itself, this kind of functionality cannot be provided by the client side software that OpenROAD uses. The OpenROAD language allows you to send a SQL statement to the connected database server and execute it there, but does not provide any direct access to the DBMS.\n'

2024-07-11T10:41:45 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nExplain system-defined functions in OpenROAD programming language.\n\n<|system|>\nOpenROAD can access other database functions used by Ingres, MSSQL, Oracle, and so on, as well as UDFs (user-defined functions) by using Execute Immediate Statement and Direct Execute Immediate Statement.\n\nProgrammers should be mindful of the implications of running a function on the client side versus the database side. For example:\n\n```\nld_date = DATE('now'); // returns the client current date and time\nSELECT :lv_searchString = DATE('now'); // returns the server current date and time\n```\n\nGenerally, the rules for parameters and return values are the same for the 4GL and SQL functions of the same name. If in doubt, see the Ingres SQL Reference Guide or the Enterprise Access documentation for specifics. Here is an example demonstrating slightly different syntax due to the hexadecimal data type indicator (note the capitalization of X/x).\n\nOpenROAD SQL statement:\n```sql\nSELECT :lv_searchString = HEX(BIT_ADD(BYTE(X'C8'), BYTE(X'5A')));\n```\nresult: 22\n\nIngres SQL statement:\n```sql\nSELECT :lv_searchString = HEX(BIT_ADD(BYTE(x'C8'), BYTE(x'5A')));\n```\nresult: 22\n\nFor more information about OpenROAD functions, see Function Libraries.\n\n## Supported and Unsupported Functions\n\nOpenROAD supports the non-SQL field() function. OpenROAD does not, however, support many Ingres scalar functions. Although you can use them in SQL statements, OpenROAD cannot process them locally.\n\nMost OpenROAD 4GL functions share the same name and functionality as the equivalent SQL function. The compiler allows the functions to be used both in 4GL programming and in standard SQL statements sent to the connected database. A few functions apply only to SQL statements, and some functions are available in 4GL code only. Here are some examples:\n\n- The string function upper() can be used in both 4GL and SQL.\n- The aggregate function count() may be used only in SQL statements.\n- The field() function is available only in 4GL code.\n- The string function replace() currently is available only in SQL statements. OpenROAD runs this SQL SELECT on the server side, and returns the result to the OpenROAD variable:\n\n```sql\nselect :lv_searchString = REPLACE('I like bananas','bananas','apples');\n```\nFor more information about OpenROAD functions, see Function Libraries."
