You can use named constants anywhere that you can use a literal in an expression, including:\n- As part of an assignment statement\n- As a search condition in a query statement\n- Serve as a condition in an if or while statement\n- Use them as part of arithmetic and/or string expressions",

For example, suppose you know the value of pi is 3.14 and you want to use that value later in your program. You can create a named constant called PI with the following statement:\n\tconstant PI := 3.14;\nOnce you have defined the named constant, you can use it anywhere in your program where you would otherwise enter the number 3.14. The benefit of using a named constant is that if the value changes later, you only need to change one statement rather than changing every place where the value was used.",
