A global variable is a simple variable that can be accessed by all scopes within the same\ninstance of an OpenROAD application. Local variables are typically used to hold data that is relevant only within a\nspecific context, while global variables are often used to hold data that is relevant across multiple contexts."}

For example,\nin the following procedure, which calculates the total cost of a purchase, two local integer variables are declared:\ncost = 0;\nqty = 0;\nThe cost variable is initialized to zero and then incremented by the product of the unit price and the quantity for each item in the list. Similarly,\nthe qty variable is initialized to zero and then incremented by the quantity for each item in the list. After all items have been processed, the total cost is returned as the result:"}
