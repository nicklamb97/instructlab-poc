2024-07-15T14:16:21 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nInstructions for GPT models should follow the same topic and category. For example, all instructions related to programming languages or tasks involving data manipulation should have similar topics. This helps ensure that the instructions are relevant and can be completed by the model. Additionally, using a variety of verbs and language structures keeps the tasks interesting and challenging for the GPT model to learn from. By doing this, you can maximize the potential of your GPT model while also ensuring that it is able to understand and complete your instructions effectively.\n\n'
2024-07-15T14:16:21 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n\nYou can use conditional statements in your instructions, such as if-else clauses or case statements. These allow for more complex logic to be expressed within a single instruction. For example, you might want to check whether an object has a certain property before performing some action on it:\n```\nif (myframe.has_property('title')) then do the following:\n  myframe.title = 'My Frame';\n```\nOr maybe you need to set multiple attributes on an object at once:\n```\ncase of myframe:\n  myframe.background color = lightblue;\n  myframe.border width = 2 pixels;\n  myframe.font size = 10 points;\n```\n"
