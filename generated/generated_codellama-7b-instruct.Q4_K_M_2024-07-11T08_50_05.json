The main difference is that a LocalVariableDeclaration has an optional specification of type and default value, while a DeclareBlock does not. A DeclareBlock is used for declaring local variables within a program, which allows you to define local variables with limited scope, usually within a block or function where they are declared. This can be useful for avoiding the clutter of global variables and make code more readable and easier to understand.",
