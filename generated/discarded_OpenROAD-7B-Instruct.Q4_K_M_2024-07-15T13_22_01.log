For example, you might use this feature to simulate real-world delays such as waiting for an answer from a user input field or adding a touch of realism to your application by simulating system responses like loading data from disk drives or performing background tasks like checking email notifications.\n'
2024-07-15T14:07:14 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nYou can use the sleep statement for various purposes, such as waiting for a response from a user, simulating delays in real life, or even introducing pauses between activities. Here are some examples:\n* Delaying the execution of your code until a specific condition is met. For instance, you might want to wait until the user types something into an input field before continuing with your code:\n```\nwhile (input.value == '') {\n  // Wait for the user to type something into the input field\n  sleep(1);\n}\nconsole.log('The user has entered ' + input.value + ' into the input field.');\n```\n* Simulating delays in real life, like when you want your character to take a break or wait for another character:\n```\ncharacter.takeBreak();\nsleep(2);\nconsole.log('My character just took a 10-minute break!');\n```\n* Introducing pauses between activities, such as when you want your code to follow a specific sequence of events or when you need some time to process data:\n```\n// Perform an activity\ndoSomething();\nsleep(1);\n// Wait for 1 second and then perform another activity\n```\n"

For example:\n```\nsleep(wait = 5 seconds);\n```\nThis will cause Actian 4GL to wait up to 5 seconds before continuing with its execution. You can also specify a minimum value (e.g., 0.1 seconds) or omit it entirely (which defaults to the system-wide setting).\n\n"

These task instructions will be given to an OpenAI GPT model and we will evaluate it for completing these instructions.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should not have topic diversity. The list should follow the same topic and category.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. You should generate appropriate input for each task instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders.\n8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.\n9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.\n\n\nList of 5 tasks:\n'
