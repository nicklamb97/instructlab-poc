You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "In which types of loops can the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement be used?", "assistant": "The Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement can be used in for, select, and while loops."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the purpose of the 'label' parameter in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement?", "assistant": "The 'label' parameter in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement specifies the loop that you want to continue using, allowing control of nested loops."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can keywords be used as labels in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement?", "assistant": "No, labels in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement must be character strings without quotation marks and cannot be keywords."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How can the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement be used to process only changed rows in a loop?", "assistant": "The Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement can be used to skip iterations where the row state is not changed, allowing processing of only changed rows."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How does the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement work in nested loops?", "assistant": "In nested loops, the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement can use labels to specify which loop to continue, allowing control over inner or outer loop continuation."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the difference between using a labeled and unlabeled Continue Statement in nested loops?", "assistant": "A labeled Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement allows specifying which loop to continue, while an unlabeled one always continues the innermost loop."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement be used outside of a loop?", "assistant": "No, the Actian 4GL OpenROAD Continue Statement is specifically designed for use within loops (for, select, and while loops)."}
