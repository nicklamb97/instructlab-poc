For example, instead of simply telling GPT what it needs to do (which is not very helpful), you can use instructions like: "Calculate the sum of all salaries for employees in the IT department."\n\n'
2024-07-15T15:35:55 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n\nInstructions should be simple and direct. You don\'t need to provide any context or background information. Just focus on what you want your model to do. For example, instead of saying something like this: "We want to determine if there are any employees working in our company who make over $100k per year." Instead say this: "Find out how many people earn more than $100k annually at our organization."\n\n'

The initial values for each attribute are set after the opening parenthesis (') and before the closing parenthesis ('). You can also specify any default values you want for numeric or character data types by using the DEFAULT clause. For example:\n```4gl\nclass Person {\n  firstname varchar(20) not null default 'John';\n  lastname varchar(20) not null default 'Doe';\n…\n}\n```\nIn this case, we have set a default value for the two string attributes – first name and last name.
