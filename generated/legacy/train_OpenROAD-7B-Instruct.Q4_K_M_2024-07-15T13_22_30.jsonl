When you declare a variable in your code, Actian 4GL automatically allocates memory for it and sets its default property values (such as its name or type). These defaults are used when your script first starts up or whenever you call a method on the variable. However, if no default was specified for the variable, then Actian 4GL will use zero instead of null as its default value. This behavior helps avoid issues with undefined variables and makes it easy to work with simple data types like strings and numbers."}
