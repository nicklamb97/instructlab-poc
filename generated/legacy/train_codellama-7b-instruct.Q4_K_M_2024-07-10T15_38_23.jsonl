Procedures can accept parameters, which are values passed to the procedure when it is called. When the procedure returns a value, it is returned in the result variable. Here is an example:\nprocedure GetName\n  name = last_name || \", \" || first_name\nreturn name"}

There are two types of logical expressions: the AND operator and the OR operator. The NOT operator inverts its operand's truth value. Here is an example:"}

Here is an example of the basic operators that can be used in OpenROAD:\n+ - * /\n** Example:\nThe expression 2 + 3 resolves to 5, which is a single value. The same expression evaluated on the left side of a minus sign (-) will result in -5, as shown below:\n\n- (2 + 3);"}

Named constants can be either predefined or defined by the programmer using the DEFINE statement. For example: #define TRUE 1 #define FALSE 0."}

You can use SELECT statements with multiple tables or views, but you cannot nest SELECT statements within queries that use aggregate functions or GROUP BY clauses.

The most common functions used in this context are SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, and COUNT. For example: @x = @y + COUNT(A) is a valid expression because the COUNT function returns a scalar value for each row in table A that satisfies the search condition."}
