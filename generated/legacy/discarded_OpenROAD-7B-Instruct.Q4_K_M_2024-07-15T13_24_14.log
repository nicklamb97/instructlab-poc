For example:\ndeclare integer age;\nThis statement declares an integer variable called 'age' with no initial value set for it. You can then reference this variable throughout your code using simple references such as 'age'.\n\n* Instruction\nWhat are some common errors you might encounter when working with Actian 4GL?\nInput\n<noinput>\nOutput\nSome common errors include syntax errors due to incorrectly written statements, type mismatches between variables and their values, undefined variables used in expressions, illegal operations performed on data types, invalid references made to nonexistent objects, or just plain old typos.\n\n* Instruction\nHow can you debug your code in Actian 4GL?\nInput\n<noinput>\nOutput\nYou can use the debugger provided with Actian Studio IDE to step through your code line by line, inspect variables and their values, set breakpoints at specific locations within your script, and even trace execution paths for complex expressions or procedures. Additionally, you can call any of your own procedures from the command line using 'call' followed by the procedure name and any required arguments.\n\n* Instruction\nWhat are some typical use cases for using sleep in Actian 4GL?\nInput\n<noinput>\nOutput\nSleep statements are often used to introduce delays in program execution, wait for user input, or pace actions within an application.

This type of scenario can help you come up with relevant examples and contexts for your instructions.\n\n"

For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should not have topic diversity. The list should follow the same topic and category.\n4.

For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.\n8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context.

For example, if you want to wake up at 7 am, then use this line of code:\nalarm at 7:00 do\n   // Open your favorite music app and play your favorite song.\nend alarm;\nOnce the alarm goes off, it will execute any code inside the block. In this example, when the alarm rings at 7:00 am, it will open your preferred music app and play your preferred tune. You can also use alarms to remind you of tasks or events. For instance, if you need to remember to water your plants every day, then set an alarm for that job with this line of code:\nalarm every day at 5:00 do\n   // Water all plants in the garden.\nend alarm;\nNow, when the alarm sounds off at 5 pm daily, it will automatically water all plants within your garden. You can customize the message shown when an alarm goes off by specifying a caption for it. For instance, if you want to remind yourself to take medication each morning, then use this line of code:\nalarm every day at 8:00 with 'Take Medication' caption do\n   // Take your prescribed medication.\nend alarm;\nNow when the alarm sounds off at 8 am daily, it will display the phrase ‘Take Medication’ on the screen and then execute any code inside the block. In this example, whenever the alarm rings at 8:00 am each day, it will remind you to take your prescribed medication and then perform whatever action is specified in the code block (such as updating a database field, sending an email message, etc.).\nTask 4\n\nYou can create a new variable in your code with the following syntax:\nvariable <name> = null;\nWhere <name> represents the desired name for your variable. For example, if you want to define a variable called ‘color’, then use this line of code:\nvariable color = null;\nNow, when you type the variable name into your code (such as in a field or method call), Actian 4GL will create it and assign it to the value of null. You can then reference this variable from other parts of your code whenever you need its services or want to perform some action related to it. In this example, when you type ‘color’ into a text field or call a function that uses colors, Actian 4GL will create the variable named ‘color’ and set it to the default value of null. You can then access this variable from other parts of your code whenever you need its services or want to perform some action related to it.\n"

Provide examples of creating arrays, enumerations, or other complex data types. Also explain how to access properties or methods on these objects.\n\nOutput: You can declare variables of any type in Actian 4GL, including complex data types like arrays and enumerations. To do this, simply state the variable name and its desired type in your code. Then assign it to whatever value you want, using standard assignment operators such as equals (=) for simple values or reference operators (ref) for references to other objects.\nFor example, if you want to create an array with five integers, you could use this statement:\nint[] myArray = new int[5];\nNow, this statement declares a new integer array variable called "myArray" that has five elements in it. Each element holds an integer value between zero and 255. You can access these elements using their index numbers or by calling methods on the array object itself. For example, if you wanted to get the third element in your array, you could use code like this:\nint thirdElement = myArray[2];\nConsole.WriteLine("Third element is {0}", thirdElement);\n'
