These instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions. Here are the requirements:\n\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction should also be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should not have topic diversity. The list should follow the same topic and category.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be one to two sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.\n8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.\n9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.\n\n\nHere are the five task instructions:\n'

2024-07-15T16:48:02 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nYou are asked to write a function that takes two strings as parameters and returns their difference in characters. This function should be used within other code segments where you need to compare string values for some reason, such as validating input data or performing calculations on textual data. The following is an example of how you can use your newly written function:\n```\ntitle = 'Welcome to OpenROAD';\nentry = prompt('What is your name?');\nif (title < entry) {\n    alert('The title is shorter than the entry.');\n} else if (title > entry) {\n    alert('The title is longer than the entry.');\n}\n```\nIn this example, the title variable holds a string value while the entry variable represents an object with another string value. When you call your comparison function between these two variables, it will return either 0 (zero) or negative 1 (one less than zero). You can then use this result to determine whether to display an error message or not.\n\nHere are some more instructions for you:\n"
