Within this block, you can write any valid Actian 4GL statements including declarations, expressions, and statements. When the try statement ends, you must include either a catch clause or a finally clause. The catch clause catches any exceptions thrown by the previous statements in your block. If you do not include a catch clause, then Actian 4GL will handle all exceptions automatically for you. On the other hand, the finally clause executes after your block has finished executing its statements.
