When you create a procedure, you specify its name and any required parameters in the Procedures dialog. Then, when your code needs to perform that procedure, it simply calls the appropriate routine by name.

For example, if you have a form where users can input their email addresses, write unit tests that simulate different inputs (such as valid emails, invalid emails, empty fields, required fields).\n2. Run your application in debug mode to identify any issues or errors. This allows you to step through the code line by line and inspect variables at each stage of execution.\n3. Use log statements to track events and errors throughout the application\u2019s lifecycle. Log statements provide detailed information about what happened when (such as when a user submitted a form), why it happened (such as why the submit button was clicked), and how it affected other parts of the system (like updating user preferences or sending notifications).\n4. Perform regression tests after making changes to ensure that no new bugs were introduced into the codebase. Regression tests help you verify that all features still work correctly together, even if you added or removed some functionality recently.\n5. Conduct acceptance testing with real users to get feedback on usability and overall satisfaction. Acceptance testing involves having actual people use your application in various situations to gather their opinions about its performance, ease of use, and value proposition.
