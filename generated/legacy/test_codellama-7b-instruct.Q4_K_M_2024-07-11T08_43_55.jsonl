Ingres scalar SQL functions\n2. Aggregate functions\n3. The ifnull() function\n4. The dbmsinfo() function\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Where can Ingres scalar SQL functions be used in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "Ingres scalar SQL functions can be used in all OpenROAD statements and in all SQL statements that are used\nlocally within OpenROAD, except for object_key() and table_key().\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How are aggregate functions used in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "Aggregate functions, which take a set of values (for example, the contents of a column in a table) as their\narguments, can only be used in OpenROAD within SQL statements.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How can OpenROAD access database functions from other systems like MSSQL or Oracle?", "assistant": "OpenROAD can access database functions from other systems like Ingres, MSSQL, Oracle, as well as UDFs\n(user-defined functions) by using Execute Immediate Statement and Direct Execute Immediate Statement.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What's the difference between running a function on the client side versus the database side in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "Running a function on the client side versus the database side can yield different results. For example:\nld_date = DATE('now'); // returns the client current date and time\nSELECT :ld_date = DATE('now'); // returns the server current date and time\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Does OpenROAD support all Ingres scalar functions?", "assistant": "No, OpenROAD does not support many Ingres scalar functions. Although you can use them in SQL statements,\nOpenROAD cannot process them locally.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can all OpenROAD 4GL functions be used in both 4GL programming and SQL statements?", "assistant": "Most OpenROAD 4GL functions share the same name and functionality as the equivalent SQL function and can be\nused in both. However, some functions are specific to either 4GL or SQL. For example, the upper() function\ncan be used in both, while count() is only for SQL and field() is only for 4GL.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How does OpenROAD handle the replace() string function?", "assistant": "The replace() string function is currently available only in SQL statements in OpenROAD. OpenROAD runs the\nSQL SELECT on the server side and returns the result to the OpenROAD variable. For example:\nselect :lv_searchString = REPLACE('I like bananas','bananas','apples');\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the field() function in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "The field() function is a non-SQL function supported by OpenROAD. It is available only in 4GL code and cannot\nbe used in SQL statements.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions.
