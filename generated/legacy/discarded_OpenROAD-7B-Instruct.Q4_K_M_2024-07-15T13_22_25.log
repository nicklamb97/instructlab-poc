2024-07-15T13:34:28 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nYou are asked to come up with a set of 5 diverse task instructions under compositional_skills->programming_languages->actian_4gl->sleep_statement for the task "Explain the sleep statement in Actian 4GL and its usage in application development.". These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should not have topic diversity. The list should follow the same topic and category.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.\n8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.\n9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.\n\nNow that you have understood the instructions better, let us try out a different set of 5 diverse tasks:\n'

This helps prevent unexpected delays in your program execution.\n- Use the sleep statement sparingly, as it can slow down your application and make it less responsive to user input.\n- Consider using other blocking operations, like I/O operations or database queries, instead of the sleep statement when possible.\n\n'
2024-07-15T13:37:24 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nYou can also create custom functions with any number of parameters in Actian 4GL. The following example demonstrates how to define a function that takes three real arguments and returns their average:\n\n```\nfunction average(c: real, d: real, e: real): real {\n    return (c + d + e) / 3;\n}\n```\n'
2024-07-15T14:01:22 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nTask 3\n\nInstructions: Can you use the sleep statement with a condition? For example, "if my name is John do this action after 10 seconds have passed."\nInput: No input required for this task.\nOutput: Yes, you can use the sleep statement with a condition in Actian 4GL. This allows for more complex logic and decision making within your code. For example, when you want to perform an action only under certain circumstances or after a specific delay has elapsed, the sleep statement is useful. However, it has a limited range of values between 0 and 100 milliseconds which may not be sufficient for waiting longer periods or specific events requiring more precise timings.\n'
2024-07-15T14:01:22 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nInstructions: What are some common uses of the sleep statement in Actian 4GL?\nInput: No input required for this task.\nOutput: Some common uses of the sleep statement in Actian 4GL include pausing execution briefly while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete, such as fetching data from a server over the network or rendering complex graphics on screen. It also enables you to introduce delays into your code that help manage real-world scenarios like animating characters moving across scenes or simulating the passage of time in games with turn-based mechanics.\n'

However, if there are any pending operations or tasks associated with that variable, they will be interrupted and need to be resumed manually by calling their respective methods again. For example:\n```\n'
2024-07-15T14:33:35 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nFor example, when you need to allocate memory for an array of integers, you can use this statement:\n```\ncreate(int) myarray;\n```\nOr if you want to destroy the same array, just type:\n```\ndelete myarray;\n```\nYou also have access to functions like length(), which returns the number of elements in a structure or enumeration. This lets you easily manage collections and their data throughout your application.\n'

For example:\ni = 'Destry';\nstatement = 'Dornish is the capital of i.';\nexecute(statement);\n\nHere are some examples of what you can do with variables in Actian 4GL:\n* You can create new ones or modify existing ones.\n* You can use them as parameters for functions and methods.\n* You can store any type of data in them, including strings, numbers, booleans, dates, times, and even complex objects like arrays and objects.\n\nYou should also consider using the sleep statement to perform simple operations on your data. For example:\nsleep(2);\nstatement = 'Dornish has a population of';\nexecute(statement);\n\nHere are some examples of what you cannot do with variables in Actian 4GL:\n* You cannot directly initialize them or set their values to null. Instead, use the default value feature when your program starts.\n* You cannot use them as return values from functions and methods. Instead, use the output parameter feature instead.\n* You cannot use them as arguments for procedures and other types of code. Instead, use the input parameter feature instead.\n\nYou should also be aware that the sleep statement is not designed for performing complex calculations on data in Actian 4GL. Instead, use the built-in functions and operators for arithmetic operations or convert your data into a format that can be used with these features.\n"
2024-07-15T14:59:17 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n* Instruction\n\nHow do I set up my own sleep statement?\n\n* Input\n\n<noinput>\n\n* Output\n\nTo create your own sleep statement, follow these steps:\n1. Open the Workbench and then double-click on the \'New Statement\' icon in the upper right corner of the Workbench window. This will open a new statement editor for you to type into.\n2. Type the desired name for your statement into the title field at the top of the editor. For example: "My Timer".\n3. In the body of the editor, enter the initial value for your timer into the \'Value\' field. This is typically zero for a countdown timer. You can also specify other properties such as duration (in seconds), precision (up to four decimal places), and whether it should loop or not after reaching zero.\n4. Click on the \'Save\' button at the bottom of the editor to save your changes. Actian 4GL will then create your new sleep statement in memory for you to use whenever you need it.\n5. To use your sleep statement, simply call it by its name in your code. For example:\n```\nmy_timer = new timer(30 seconds);\nmy_timer.start();\n```\n6. When you want to stop the timer, just use the \'stop\' method on it. This will cause Actian 4GL to immediately end the timer and remove any remaining data from memory associated with it.\n7. You can also check the status of your sleep statement at any time by calling its \'status\' property. This returns an integer value that represents how much time remains until the timer reaches zero. A value of zero indicates that the timer has already reached its final state and there is no more data to process.\n8. Finally, you can set up alarms or notifications for when your sleep statement reaches certain thresholds or milestones. For example:\n```\nmy_timer.on_change(function (new value) {\n  alert(\'My timer has changed its value to \' + new value + \' seconds.\');\n});\n```\n9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.\n\n\nList of 5 tasks (continued):\n'

The same concept applies to any other kind of statement or function that you might want to pause temporarily, such as I/O operations (reading from a file, writing to an output device), mathematical calculations (solving equations, performing trigonometry), or even complex AI algorithms (training neural networks, optimizing decision trees).\n'
