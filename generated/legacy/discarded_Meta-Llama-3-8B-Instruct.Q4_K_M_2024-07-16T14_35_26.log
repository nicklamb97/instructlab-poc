Assume the product prices are stored in a separate array called "prices".\nInput:\n```\nproducts := ["TV", "Laptop", "Tablet", "Smartphone", "Gaming Console"];\nprices := [500, 1000, 200, 300, 800];\ntotal_price := 0;\nfor i = 1 to size(products) do\n    total_price += prices[i-1];\nendfor;\n```\nOutput:\n\n**Task 2**\nInstruction: What is the purpose of the FOR statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD? How does it differ from other looping constructs like DO WHILE and FOREACH?\nInput:\n<noinput>\nOutput:\nThe FOR statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD is used to iterate over a range of values or an array. Unlike DO WHILE, which loops until a condition is met, the FOR statement specifies the exact number of iterations required.

2024-07-16T17:06:00 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nI\'d be happy to help! Here are five diverse task instructions under compositional_skills->programming_languages->actian_4gl->for_statement for the task "Write Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statements":\n\nTask 1:\n** Instruction\nHow does the step parameter work in Actian 4GL OpenROAD For statements and can you provide an example of its use?\n** Input <noinput>\n** Output\nThe `by` keyword allows you to specify a step size for the loop. For example, this loop will iterate over values 1, 3, 5:\n```\nfor i = 1 to 10 by 2 do\n    message \'Current value: \' || char(i);\nendfor;\n```\n\nTask 2:\n** Instruction\nWhat is the purpose of endexpression in an Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement, and provide an example?\n** Input <noinput>\n** Output\nThe `endexpression` determines the loop\'s termination condition. Here\'s an example:\n```\nmax_value = 10;\nfor i = 1 to max_value do\n    message \'Current value: \' || char(i);\nendfor;\n```\nIn this code, the for statement iterates from 1 to 10.\n\nTask 3:\n** Instruction\nCan you demonstrate how to use a For loop with multiple variables in Actian 4GL OpenROAD and provide an example?\n** Input\nDeclare three integer variables x, y, z; initialize them to 0.\n** Output\nYou can declare multiple variables for the `for` statement by separating each variable declaration with a comma. Here\'s an example:\n```\nx = 0;\ny = 0;\nz = 0;\nfor i = 1 to 5, j = 2 to 6, k = 3 to 7 do\n    message \'Current values: x=\' || char(x) || \', y=\' || char(y) || \', z=\' || char(z);\nendfor;\n```\nIn this code, the for statement will iterate over values i=1-5, j=2-6, and k=3-7.\n\nTask 4:\n** Instruction\nHow do you specify an initialization expression in Actian 4GL OpenROAD For statements, and provide an example?\n** Input\nCreate a variable named total that is initialized to 0.\n** Output\nYou can specify an initialization expression using the `init` keyword. Here\'s an example:\n```\ntotal = init(0);\nfor i = 1 to 10 do\n    total = total + i;\nmessage \'Total: \' || char(total);\nendfor;\n```\n\nTask 5:\n** Instruction\nCan you provide a real-world scenario where For loops are commonly used in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\n** Input <noinput>\n** Output\nFor loops can be used to iterate over data, such as processing records from a database. For example, this code iterates over the rows of a table called `customer_info` and prints each record:\n```\nfor row = 1 to num_rows do\n    message \'Customer ID: \' || char(row) || \', Name: \' || char(get_row(\'name\', row));\nendfor;\n```\n\nI hope these tasks meet your requirements!
