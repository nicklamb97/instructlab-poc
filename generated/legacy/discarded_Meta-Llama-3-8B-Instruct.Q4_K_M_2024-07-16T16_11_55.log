These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions. Here are the requirements: 1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity. 2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions. 3. The type of instructions should not have topic diversity. The list should follow the same topic and category. 4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action. 5. The instructions should be in English. 6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted. 7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words. 8. Not all instructions require input.

Provide an example to illustrate its usage.\n\n**Input**\n\ndisplay_current_status;\n\n**Output**\nThe primary purpose of the SLEEP statement is to pause program execution for a specified duration. Here\'s an example:\n```\nSLEEP 2; // pause program execution for 2 seconds\nMESSAGE "Program paused for 2 seconds.";\n```\n5. **Instruction**\nCan you demonstrate how to use sleep statements in OpenROAD procedures with conditional logic to create more dynamic delay times?\n\n**Input**\n\nIF iteration_number > 5 THEN\n    <!-- adjust delay time based on condition -->\nENDIF;\n\n**Output**\nTo dynamically adjust delay times using conditional logic, you can combine the SLEEP statement with a logical expression. Here\'s an example:\n```\nFOR i = 1 TO 10 DO\n    MESSAGE "Iteration: " || i;\n    IF MOD(i, 3) = 0 THEN\n        sleep 1; // pause for 1 second on every third iteration\n    ELSE\n        sleep 0.5; // pause for 0.5 seconds otherwise\nENDFOR;\n```'
