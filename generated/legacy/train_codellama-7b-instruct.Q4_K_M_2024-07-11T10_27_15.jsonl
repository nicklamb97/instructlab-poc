This is then compared to a list of classes using the = operator. By comparing a single expression against multiple values, we can eliminate repetitive code and reduce the number of execution paths in our code. This is particularly useful when dealing with many different class comparisons."}

You can also use the default keyword to execute code if no other case is matched.\nYou can nest Case Statements and execute multiple blocks based on conditions that are mutually exclusive. You can also use the nextcase statement inside a case block to skip directly from one block to the next.\nExamples of using Case Statement:\n1. Check if a variable is not empty, execute code block 1; If it is, check if its length is greater than 0 and then execute code block 2. If that too does not match, execute code block 3;\n```\ncase inputselection of\n          begin_synonym :\n          {\n               field(menu.edit_menu.paste).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               field(menu.file_menu.save_spec).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               curframe.WindowTitle = curframe.WindowTitle + 'Beginner';\n          }\n```\n2.

What are some examples?", "assistant": "To avoid repetition in a case statement, you can:\n1. Use switch statements instead of case statements to reduce repetition and code size. You should only use a case statement if there is no equivalent switch statement available for your programming language or the problem does not fit well with the switch structure.\n2. Instead of having multiple code blocks to execute for each possible condition, you can combine all these conditions into one block by using the nextcase statement inside the block or using the default keyword. You can nest Case Statements and execute multiple blocks based on conditions that are mutually exclusive.\n3. Define a separate class definition file with its unique object attributes and methods, then use these class definitions in the case statement to avoid repeating code for each object.\nExample of avoiding repetition:\nYou have defined five types of objects with different properties, but you need to perform the same action on all of them (you can't change their classes). You can create a separate class definition file for each type and use these class definitions in a case statement to avoid repeating code. Here is an example:\n```\ncase inputselection.Class of\n          SubForm : ...\n          CompositeField : ...\n          ...\nendcase;\n```\n4. Use default keyword if you have to execute the same block for multiple cases. This is useful when there are more than one value that falls into a single case or the cases do not overlap each other. You can also use the default statement alone without any valuelist, which will execute it for all values that do not match any of the previous valuelists.\nExample:\n```\ncase inputselection of\n     default : value = 0;\n     'one'   : value = 1;\n     'two'   : value = 2;\n     'three' : value = 3;\nendcase;\n```\nIn this example, the code will run for any value other than the specific values of one, two and three.|assistant|>"}

In other words, the execution of code inside of the block ends and immediately moves on to execute the following statement block without first executing any code in the next block. For example: `case expression of {value1: statement | beginendblock} {nxtcs; statement | beginendblock}`"}

This allows multiple values to be compared and execute one or more blocks of code based on those matched values."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is nextcase statement in OpenROAD Actian 4GL case statement?", "assistant": "The nextcase statement allows a program to continue executing the statements within the same block after one block has been executed and skips over any code that follows the statement until the end of the current case block. This allows you to have multiple cases execute for a single key value and can greatly clean up your coding."}

The normal case statement can be used to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and the nextcase statement can be used to skip to the beginning of the next statement block (this is equivalent to falling through from one case block to another in C)."}

The valuelists are used to match the selected value from the menu with the corresponding code block that will be executed. For example:\n```\ncase choice of\n    1 : begin ... end;\n    2 : begin ... end;\n    3 : begin ... end;\n    default : message 'Unknown option' + choice + '.';\nendcase;\n```"}

You can use a case statement to do this as follows:\n```\ncase lowercase(inputselection) of\n          begin_synonym :\n          {\n               field(menu.edit_menu.paste).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               field(menu.file_menu.save_spec).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               curframe.WindowTitle = curframe.WindowTitle + 'Beginner';\n          }\n          not inter_synonym :\n          {\n               field(menu.edit_menu.paste).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               /*\n               ** Do advanced stuff also.\n               */\n               nextcase;\n          }\n          advance_synonym :\n          {\n               field(menu.file_menu.save_spec).curbias = MB_ENABLED;\n          }\n          default:\n               message 'Unknown selection' + inputselection + '!';\n          endcase;\n```\nThe \"Not\" keyword negates the value of the expression, so if `inputselection` is 'Beginner', the code inside the `begin_synonym :` statement will be executed. If it is not equal to Beginner (it could be Intermediate or Advanced), then the `not inter_synonym :` case will be skipped and execution will continue on the next statement block, which in this example is `advance_synonym :`."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can you make an array of case statements using the Case Statement?", "assistant": "Yes, you can use a case statement to define and execute a set of actions based on an integer value. This is useful when there are only a few possible options for a given variable that can be chosen from. Here's an example:\n```\ncase inputselection of\n          begin_synonym :\n          {\n               field(menu.edit_menu.paste).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               field(menu.file_menu.save_spec).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               curframe.WindowTitle = curframe.WindowTitle + 'Beginner';\n          }\n          1, 2 :\n          {\n               field(menu.edit_menu.paste).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               /*\n               ** Do advanced stuff also.\n               */\n               nextcase;\n          }\n          advance_synonym :\n          {\n               field(menu.file_menu.save_spec).curbias = MB_ENABLED;\n          }\n          default:\n               message 'Unknown selection' + inputselection + '!';\n          endcase;\n```\nHere the `inputselection` variable is an integer value between 1 and 3, inclusive. The first two cases specify that if `inputselection` equals either 1 or 2, the code inside this case block will be executed (and the nextcase statement will cause execution to pass to the next case block)."}

A Case statement is used when you want to select a single action based on the value of an expression while an If statement is used to check conditions in sequence or branch to next case if false."}
