2024-07-15T13:55:56 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nInstruction\nHow do you change attributes on an existing object in Actian 4GL?\nInput\n<noinput>\nOutput\nTo modify attributes of an existing object in Actian 4GL, use the attribute assignment syntax. This allows for easy updating of properties or values within your code without requiring you to create a new instance of the class. For example:\nmyCar.model = 'Ferrari F40';\nwhere 'myCar' is a reference to the previously declared Car object, and its model property is being updated with the specified value 'Ferrari F40'. You can also use this syntax when setting attributes for objects or defining constants within your code.\n"
2024-07-15T13:55:56 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nInstruction\nWhat are the benefits of using Actian 4GL over other programming languages?\nInput\n<noinput>\nOutput\nActian 4GL offers several advantages over other programming languages, including its robust object-oriented design and powerful built-in functions. These features make it ideal for developing complex applications that require extensive data manipulation or intricate logic. Additionally, Actian 4GL has a large community of developers who contribute to its open source project, providing constant updates and improvements to the language. This ensures compatibility with other systems and tools, as well as ensuring that your code will be supported long into the future. Furthermore, because of its simplicity and flexibility, you can easily learn Actian 4GL even if you are new to programming or have little experience in other languages.\n'

When this date and time are reached, the program resumes its execution automatically. The syntax for setting an alarm with the sleep statement is as follows:\nsleep(hours: 2, minutes: 30);\nwhere 'hours' and 'minutes' are integers representing the number of hours and minutes respectively until which you want to delay the execution of your program. You can also specify a deadline (a date) instead of a simple integer for hours or minutes. The following example demonstrates how to set an alarm for waking up at 10:30 pm on Friday, May 13th:\nsleep(date: May 13th, time: 20:30);\n"

2024-07-15T14:34:57 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nInstruction\nHow do you wake up an object or call its methods?\nInput\n<noinput>\nOutput\nTo wake up an object and call its methods in Actian 4GL, you can use the dot notation (.). This allows for easy access to members of complex types such as arrays or structures. For example:\nmy_car.drive();\nwhere 'my car' is a reference to the object representing your vehicle that has been initialized with attributes like make, model, year etc.. When you call this method on it, you tell Actian 4GL to perform all necessary operations required by driving your vehicle – including starting its engine, adjusting seat positions, setting up mirrors, and so on.\n"
2024-07-15T14:34:57 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nInstruction\nHow can you create a new record in the database?\nInput\n<noinput>\nOutput\nTo add a new entry into the database, you can use the insert statement (insert into). This allows for easy manipulation of data and provides a clear syntax when declaring attributes or setting values for your records. For example:\ninsert into customers (customer_name, phone_number) values (‘ABC Distributors’, ‘555-1234’);\nwhere 'ABC Distributors' is the name of our customer company and '555-1234' are its corresponding phone number attributes set to those values. You can also use this syntax when defining relationships between objects – like linking customers to their respective sales representatives or specifying foreign keys for enforcing referential integrity across tables in your schema.\n"

2024-07-15T14:44:26 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nYou can now add attributes to your objects with ease. The attribute syntax is similar to that of properties, allowing you to define attributes on any type of object. For example:\n```\nobject = new class(name = 'Car');\nobject.make = 'Ford';\nobject.model = 'Mustang';\nobject.color = #FF0000;\n```\nIn this example, we create a car object with the name ‘Mustang’ and set its make attribute to ‘Ford’. The color attribute is then set to red (#FF0000). You can also use attributes as properties for your objects. For instance:\n```\nobject.speed = 120;\nconsole.log(object.make + ' is driving at ' + object.speed + ' mph');\n```\nHere, we set the speed property on our car object to 120 mph and log it out to the console. You can use attributes in any way you like, such as storing data or representing relationships between objects.\n\nNow that you have learned about attributes, let's move on to discussing more advanced topics related to Actian 4GL and its capabilities. For example:\n* How do you create custom functions in Actian 4GL?\n** Instruction\nWrite a simple function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.\n** Input\n```\nfunction add(n1, n2) {\n  return n1 + n2;\n}\n```\n** Output\nThe above code defines an addition function which takes two integers as parameters and returns the result of adding them together. You can call this function from within your code or even use it with other types of data, such as strings or arrays.\n* How about creating complex objects like lists or trees in Actian 4GL?\n** Instruction\nWrite a short program which creates a new list containing five elements (of any type).\n** Input\n```\nlist = new class(name = 'List', elements = []);\nfor (i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\n  list.elements[i] = new object(type = 'String', value = i + ' ');\n}\nconsole.log('Created a list of five elements: ' + list.elements);\n```\n** Output\nThe above code creates a new list object with the name ‘List’ and five element properties. Each element property holds an object representing one of the five strings from 0 to 4 (inclusive). The log statement then displays the created list in the console, showing its elements and their values. You can now use this list in your code or even modify its contents however you like.\n"

This allows for efficient use of resources and ensures that data is up-to-date even when performing background tasks. For example, if you want your application to check for new messages every 15 minutes, you can use the wake statement with a sleep duration of 900 seconds (15 minutes * 60 seconds per minute).\n'

Task 1\n** Instruction\nHow can you use the sleep statement to add pauses of different durations throughout your code?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nYou can call the sleep function multiple times within your code and specify different durations for each call. The following example demonstrates how to do this:\n```\nsleep(3 seconds); // Pause program execution for 3 seconds\n```\n2. Task 2\n** Instruction\nHow can you set up alarms and reminders in Actian 4GL?\n** Input\n<nooutput>\n** Output\nYou cannot create visual or audio outputs with Actian 4GL. Therefore, you cannot set up alarms and reminders in the language. Instead, use the sleep statement to pause program execution for a specified duration, such as when you want to display an announcement or prompt the user about something important.\n3. Task 3\n** Instruction\nWhat are some common uses of the sleep statement?\n** Input\n<nooutput>\n** Output\nYou can use the sleep statement to add pauses of different durations throughout your code. For example, you might want to delay a response from a server or wait for an asynchronous task to complete before continuing with your program. The following examples demonstrate how to do this:\n```\nsleep(5 seconds); // Pause program execution for 5 seconds\n```\n'
