This format allows you to define the size of the field exactly, preventing overflows or underflows for that specific column in your table. For example, in the following code snippet:\n```\ncreate table author (\n  name varchar(50),\n  birthdate date not null,\n  address text(100) null,\n  phone number(10) primary key;\n```\nHere, we define the 'name' column as a variable-length string with a maximum length of 50 characters. The other fields in this example are also defined using their appropriate formats:\n• ‘birthdate’ is a date data type with no allowance for null values (not null specification),\n• ‘address’ is a text field that can contain up to 100 characters, and\n• ‘phone’ is a numeric field representing phone numbers, set as the primary key for this table.\nYou can then use these fields in your code, such as setting values, performing calculations, or displaying them on forms or reports.

Similarly, when reading data from an external text file, any control characters or tabs are also converted to spaces before being stored in memory.\nWhen specifying delimiters for variable-length strings, use the 5-character right-justified length specifier. For example:\n```sql\nCOPY staff_list (\n    first_name CHAR(20), last_name CHAR(30), title CHAR(10));\n```\nIn this example, the 'CHAR' keyword specifies that the field should be treated as a fixed-length string of the specified length. The length specifier follows it, which is 20 characters for 'first_name', 30 characters for 'last_name', and 10 characters for 'title'. When copying data into or out of the file, any control characters or tabs are padded with zeros before being stored in memory.\n* When using Actian 4GL with other systems or databases, it is important to understand how they handle delimiters and field names.

Similarly, you can use the null keyword to set the field's initial value to its default value:\nauthors (null) = null;\nThis sets the 'authors' variable to its default value of 'null'. You can also use the zero keyword to represent the integer zero for numeric fields."}

When on_error is set to CONTINUE, copy displays a warning whenever a conversion error occurs, skips the row that caused the error, and continues processing the remaining rows. At the end of the processing, copy displays a message indicating how many warnings were issued and how many rows were successfully copied. Setting error_count specifies how many errors can occur before processing terminates. By default, copy terminates when an error occurs while converting between table format and file format."}

This delimiter is particularly useful when designing custom formats for importing and exporting complex data types, such as:\n• Objects with multiple attributes (e.g., customers),\n• Enumerated types (e.g., gender or color), or\n• Numeric values that require specific precision (e.g., money).\nFor example, in the following code snippet:\n```\ncreate table vehicle (\n  make char(20) not null,\n  model varchar(40) unique,\n  year numeric(4,2) primary key;\n```\nHere, we define the 'make' column as a fixed-length string with no allowance for null values. The other fields in this example are also defined using their appropriate formats:\n• ‘model’ is a variable-length string with unique values representing different vehicle makes and models, and\n• ‘year’ is a numeric field representing the vehicle’s production year, set as the primary key for this table.\nYou can then use these fields in your code, such as setting values, performing calculations, or displaying them on forms or reports. The 'X' delimiter is used here to separate the columns and mark the end of records in the data file."}

Incorrect delimiter selection can lead to parsing errors or data corruption. For example, if you choose a character as the delimiter and it appears in the data, the parser will not be able to distinguish between the field value and the delimiter. This can cause issues when trying to read or write data to/from the field. Similarly, if you use a numeric format for a field that contains non-numeric data, the database manager will attempt to convert the data to the appropriate format. This can result in errors or loss of data integrity."}
