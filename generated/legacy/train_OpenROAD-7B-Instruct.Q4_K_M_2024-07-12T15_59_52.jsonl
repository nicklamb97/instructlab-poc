The 'returning' clause is optional and OpenROAD Actian 4GL will automatically assign it the default value of 'none' when you create your LocalProcedureDeclaration. This allows for flexibility in your code and reduces the need for unnecessary declarations."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What happens when you call a local procedure that has not been initialized yet?", "assistant": "When you try to access or use the attributes or methods of an uninitialized local procedure in OpenROAD Actian 4GL, it will result in an error message being displayed. This helps prevent any unexpected behavior or data loss due to uninitialized variables. It also ensures that your code is well-tested and free from potential issues when running it through the interpreter or debugger."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How can you initialize multiple attributes at once within a local procedure?", "assistant": "You can use constructors in OpenROAD Actian 4GL to quickly initialize all of your local procedure's attributes when it is created. Constructors are special methods that get called automatically when an object is constructed, allowing for easy setup and configuration of complex objects like local procedures. They can take any number of parameters, which you define when declaring the constructor in your code. Once the constructor finishes executing, all of its attributes will be initialized with the values you provided or their default ones if not specified otherwise. This makes it simple to manage large sets of data or perform complex operations without having to write lots of boilerplate code."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What are some common uses cases for LocalProcedures in OpenROAD Actian 4GL?", "assistant": "Local procedures can be used for a wide variety of purposes within your scripts, such as encapsulating functionality that is only needed within a specific script, managing complex data structures like lists and arrays, performing operations on attributes or methods, or even creating custom objects with unique behavior. They promote code organization and modularity by allowing you to group related functionality into one easily manageable unit. This helps reduce the amount of boilerplate code required when working with large scripts or performing complex tasks, making it easier for developers to focus on what matters most in their projects while also ensuring their code is well-tested and free from potential issues."}
