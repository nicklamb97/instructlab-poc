If FALSE, membershipStatus variable is set to "Regular".\n\nTask 2:\n** Instruction\nHow does the code handle conditional expressions in C# versus Actian 4GL?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn both languages, the same syntax and logic are used for conditional expressions. However, Actian 4GL has a \nsimpler syntax with fewer keywords. For example, in C# you would write:\nIF (isPremiumMember) THEN membershipStatus = \'Premium\' ELSE membershipStatus = \'Regular\'\nIn Actian 4GL, you can simply write:\nSET membershipStatus TO \'Premium\' IF isPremiumMember IS TRUE\nOr for the nested conditional expression:\nSET isEligibleForDiscount TO TRUE IF membershipStatus IS \'Regular\' AND age > 60 OR totalPurchase > 100\n\nTask 3:\n** Instruction\nHow does the code output information to the user in C# versus Actian 4GL?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn both languages, the same syntax and logic are used for displaying information to the user. However, Actian 4GL has a \nsimpler syntax with fewer keywords. For example, in C# you would write:\nCONSOLE.WRITELINE($"Age: {age}");\nIn Actian 4GL, you can simply write:\nDISPLAY \'Age: \', age;\n\nTask 4:\n** Instruction\nHow does the code initialize variables in C# versus Actian 4GL?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn both languages, the same syntax and logic are used for initializing variables. However, Actian 4GL has a simpler syntax with fewer keywords. For example, in C# you would write:\ndeclare integer age = 65;\nIn Actian 4GL, you can simply write:\nCREATE INTEGER AGE = 65;\n\nTask 5:\n** Instruction\nHow does the code handle conditional expressions for discount eligibility in C# versus Actian 4GL?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn both languages, the same syntax and logic are used for handling conditional expressions for discount eligibility. However, Actian 4GL has a simpler syntax with fewer keywords. For example, in C# you would write:\nIF (membershipStatus IS \'Regular\') THEN\nSET isEligibleForDiscount TO TRUE IF age > 60 OR totalPurchase > 100;\nIn Actian 4GL, you can simply write:\nSET isEligibleForDiscount TO TRUE IF membershipStatus IS \'Regular\' AND age > 60 OR totalPurchase > 100;\n\nThe code first defines and initializes the necessary variables. It determines the membership status between premium and regular members. It uses nested conditional expressions to decide if the person is eligible for a discount. Finally, it outputs the relevant information to the user.\n\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n'

2024-07-12T16:44:13 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nBased on the document provided, here are five tasks with their respective instructions:\n\nTask 1:\n** Instruction\nHow does the code determine the membership status of a user?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe code uses an IF statement to check if `isPremiumMember` is TRUE. If it is, then `membershipStatus` is set to "Premium". Otherwise, it sets `membershipStatus` to "Regular". This allows for easy management of different membership levels and their associated privileges or restrictions within the application.\n\nTask 2:\n** Instruction\nWhat happens when the code determines that a user is not eligible for a discount?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn this scenario, no discount will be applied to the user\'s purchase. This is because the code has already verified and found that they do not meet the required conditions for eligibility (either being a premium member or satisfying additional criteria such as age greater than 60 or total purchase amount greater than 100). As a result, there will be no adjustment made to the final price of their transaction.\n'
