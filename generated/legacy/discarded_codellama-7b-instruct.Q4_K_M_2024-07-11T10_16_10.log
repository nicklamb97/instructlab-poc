What is the difference between the cursession.processwait and cursession.processwindow session class attributes?\n5. Describe one potential use case where a program developer might want to use call runimage instead of the call system statement.\n<|user|>\nGreat! Here are my responses to the questions:\n1. When the application needs to interact with other applications and get their output back. For example, you can have an OpenROAD form that allows users to select files from a server or a different client and use call system statement to copy these files into another location. In this case, the OpenROAD application is not blocking because it is returning after calling the operating system command.\n2. The CallSystemStatus attribute is used by the call system statement to return status information about the executed operating system command. This allows an application to determine if the command completed successfully or not, and why it failed or succeeded.\n3. CurSession.CallSystemStatus is the session class attribute that is used by the call system statement to execute an operating system command.\n4. The cursession.processwindow session class attribute controls whether the OpenROAD application is displayed as a window when using the call system statement. If set to true, the OpenROAD application runs in the background and the user can continue to interact with other applications. This attribute cannot be used when running under a desktop environment since this attribute is ignored if the DesktopEnvironment global variable evaluates to true.\n5. The program developer might want to use call runimage instead of the call system statement because the call system statement uses an operating system shell command (either cmd or sh depending on the platform). This can be insecure when executing commands that come from user input because it is easy for a malicious user to exploit the OpenROAD application's access to execute arbitrary operating system commands. Call runimage does not use any operating system command but instead runs the image with the specified file name as the command line argument. Therefore, call runimage is more secure than the call system statement when executing arbitrary commands from user input.\n"

When control returns to the application, execution resumes with the statement immediately following the call system statement. The call system statement can return status information to the application (see the SessionObject class attribute CallSystemStatus Attribute).\n\nWhen the called application blocks the calling application, there is no direct communication method between the OpenROAD application and the called application. For indirect communication, you can write out files that can be read by the other application or put data in the database that can be read in by the other application.\n\nAlthough you can use the call system statement to start a second application, you can start a new OpenROAD application more efficiently by using the call runimage statement.\n\nSee the Call Statement for information about using the call runimage statement.\n\n### Parameters--Call System Statement\n\nThis statement has the following parameter:\n\n#### systemcommand\n\nSpecifies a string expression that must evaluate to a single operating system command. If you specify systemcommand, the statement executes the command and returns automatically to the application, either immediately after starting the command (if CurSession.ProcessWait=FALSE) or after the command has finished (if CurSession.ProcessWait=TRUE). In the latter case the application can inquire the status of the executed command by using the CurSession.CallSystemStatus attribute. If you do not specify a system command, the statement puts the user at the operating system prompt (if CurSession.ProcessWindow=TRUE). The user can then execute any operating system commands and return to the application by entering the exit command.\n\n### Example--Call System Statement\n\nCall the operating system to execute the command specified in the cmdname field on the current form:\n\n```\ncall system cmdname;\n\n```\n\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n'

This means that the program executing the statement will continue running at the same time as the started image. The new image is created by calling the runimage function in the standard library (see the Standard Library Reference manual).\n\nThe filename parameter specifies the name of an image file containing the OpenROAD application to start. If the image has already been loaded, it will be reused; otherwise a new copy of the image is loaded from the file named by the filename parameter. When you use runimage, be aware that all objects created by the program running in the new image are stored in the new image\'s object directory unless you specify the -n parameter, in which case they will be stored in the calling application\'s object directory.\n\nHere is an example to demonstrate this statement:\n\n```\ncall runimage c:\\myprogram\\newapp.img;\n```\nThe command line above starts a new image from the file named c:\\myprogram\\newapp.img. The new image is created using the default object directory, unless the -n parameter is also given. For example:\n\n```\ncall runimage c:\\myprogram\\newapp.img -n c:\\temp\\newapp.obj;\n```\nWhen you use call runimage, be aware that if an error occurs during startup, then the started application will not run and OpenROAD will continue running as normal, with no indication of the error to the user. For this reason, it is generally a good idea to check the status of the new application after starting it.\n\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n'

How to use it?\n* Input\n<noinput>\n* Output\nThis statement calls the operating system. When control returns to the application, execution resumes with the statement immediately following the call system statement. The call system statement can return status information to the application (see the SessionObject class attribute CallSystemStatus Attribute). When the called application blocks the calling application, there is no direct communication method between the OpenROAD application and the called application. For indirect communication, you can write out files that can be read by the other application or put data in the database that can be read in by the other application. Although you can use the call system statement to start a second application, you can start a new OpenROAD application more efficiently by using the call runimage statement. See the Call Statement for information about using the call runimage statement.\nThis statement has the following parameter: systemcommand. Specifies a string expression that must evaluate to a single operating system command. If you specify systemcommand, the statement executes the command and returns automatically to the application, either immediately after starting the command (if CurSession.ProcessWait=FALSE) or after the command has finished (if CurSession.ProcessWait=TRUE). In the latter case the application can inquire the status of the executed command by using the CurSession.CallSystemStatus attribute. If you do not specify a system command, the statement puts the user at the operating system prompt (if CurSession.ProcessWindow=TRUE). The user can then execute any operating system commands and return to the application by entering the exit command.\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\nTask 1 What effect does using CurSession.ProcessWait in the OpenROAD Actian 4GL Call System Statement have? If FALSE, the statement returns immediately after starting the command; if TRUE, it waits until the command has finished and can provide status information. Task 2 What effect does using the CurSession.ProcessWait parameter in the OpenROAD Actian 4GL Call Runimage Statement have? If TRUE, then the statement waits until the called application has finished and can provide status information; if FALSE, the statement returns immediately after starting the called application.

For example, call system "move c:\\myfile1.dat c:\\myfile2.dat". This moves the file named myfile1.dat in the C drive to a directory called myfile2.dat in the C drive.\n* Deleting a file on the system. For example, call system "del c:\\myfile.txt". This deletes the file named myfile.txt located in the C drive.\n* Creating a new directory. For example, call system "mkdir c:\\newdirectory". This creates a new directory called newdirectory on the C drive.\n* Changing to a different drive or directory. For example, call system "cd e:", where e: is the name of your secondary hard drive. This changes your current drive to the E drive. You can also specify a relative path in the command string, for example cd newdirectory, which moves you down one directory within the current drive (or directory).\n* Displaying the contents of a file on the screen or printer. For example, call system "type c:\\myfile.txt". This displays the contents of the myfile.txt file located in the C drive on your screen. To print it, you can redirect output to the printer device by typing call system "type c:\\myfile.txt > lpt1:", where lpt1 is the name of the first parallel port on the computer.\n* Starting a program from the command line. For example, call system "cmd /c myprogram.exe". This starts your own program called myprogram.exe.\n* Running a script file. For example, call system "cmd /k myscript.cmd" or "call system "cmd /k myscript.cmd" and run the contents of this script file (myscript.cmd), which should be located in the same directory as the calling program. The syntax is cmd /k [scriptfile]\n* Changing to a different user. For example, call system "runas /user:joe", where joe is a valid username on the computer, and this command starts a new process with the security context of user joe. If you don\'t specify an account name or password, the dialog box for entering credentials will appear and prompts the user to enter his/her username and password to authenticate the request.\n* Exiting the operating system and returning to the calling program. For example, call system "exit", which exits the OpenROAD environment and returns control to the parent application (or process) that made the callsystem statement.'

Explain any additional features that may be required or provided by Actian 4GL in order to enable the call system statement to return status information.\n\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe Call System Statement can return status information through its attribute CurSession.CallSystemStatus. The CurSession object is an instance of class SessionObject and is created automatically when the session starts. It provides a property called CallSystemStatus that has one of several possible values: Running, Suspended, and Terminated. For example, if the command executes immediately after being executed, the value will be Running. If the command is suspended or terminated, the corresponding status will be returned.\nAnother way to return status information is by using the command-line option /status. When this option is specified, the status of the command is sent to the standard output device, which can be a terminal or a pipe that redirects the output. If you are running the OpenROAD application interactively in a console window, then the status will appear on the console screen.\nThe third way is by using an event-driven programming construct such as the SessionObject.CallSystemEvent event. This event is raised when the command finishes execution, regardless of whether it executes immediately or if it suspends or terminates before finishing. When this event is raised, you can query CurSession.CallSystemStatus to find out what happened with the command.'

For example, what specific topic do you want information on?\n\n<|user|>\nI want to know if there is any way of communicating between OpenROAD Applications and applications that are called using Call System Statement in Actian 4GL. I want to understand how to use this functionality to develop an OpenROAD application which can interact with another application using the same language.\n<|assistant|>\nI am happy to assist you in understanding how to use the Call System statement for communication between different applications. However, it would be more productive if I could provide answers based on what you have asked me so far. Could you please provide some examples of your previous questions? This will help me understand your requirements better and give you a more accurate answer.\n\n<|user|>\nYes, you can use the call system statement for communication between OpenROAD applications. There are two ways to do this:\n1) Using an open file: One application can open a file and another application that has the call system statement can read or write from the file. 2) Using a database operation: Another approach is for one application to store data in a database table, and another application that has the call system statement can retrieve this data from the database table.\n<|assistant|>\nI understand that you want to know about two ways of communicating between OpenROAD applications using call system statement. Can you please tell me what specifically are you interested in knowing? Are there any examples or questions you have in mind for this topic?\n<|user|>\nI would like to know some more about these communication methods and if they can be used inter-operably. Also, what are the performance benefits of using call runimage versus call system?\n<|assistant|>\nI understand that you want to compare the performance benefits of call runimage versus call system. Can you please provide me with some examples for comparison or ask a specific question related to these two approaches? I am happy to help answer your questions and provide you with more details on the topic.\n<|user|>\nHere are the requirements:\n1) Provide examples of starting an OpenROAD application using call runimage statement and call system statement.\n2) Explain the difference between these two approaches (call runimage vs call system).\n3) Can direct communication occur between applications called via Call System Statement? If so, what methods can be used for direct communication? If not, how do indirect communication work?\n<|assistant|>\nI understand that you want me to provide examples of starting an OpenROAD application using call runimage statement and call system statement and explain the difference between these two approaches (call runimage vs call system). Additionally, you want to know if direct communication can occur between applications called via Call System Statement and what methods can be used for indirect communication. I am happy to provide answers to your questions in this regard. Here are some examples of starting an OpenROAD application using call runimage statement:\n* Starting a new OpenROAD application using call runimage statement in Actian 4GL:\ncall runimage "c:\\actian\\mynewapp";\n* Starting a new OpenROAD application using call runimage statement in Actian 4GL and specifying the name of an image file that contains the application code or data to be executed:\ncall runimage "c:\\actian\\mynewapp" imagefile=”MyImageFile.ex”.\nHere is how you start a new OpenROAD application using call system statement in Actian 4GL:\n* Starting a new OpenROAD application using call system statement in Actian 4GL:\ncall system "c:\\actian\\mynewapp\\myapp.exe";\nIn addition to the difference between these two approaches, I would like to highlight some key points that can help you understand the concept of direct communication and indirect communication between OpenROAD applications using call runimage statement and call system statement. Here are some points to consider:\n* Direct communication can occur when one application calls another application via a file or database operation. This is because the called application can read or write from the files and/or database table of the calling application.\n* Indirect communication occurs between different applications when one application writes data to a file or puts data in a database table that can be accessed by the other application. For example, an application running on one machine can put data in a database table of another application running on the same machine. This indirect communication does not involve direct communication and is not synchronous.\n* When using call runimage statement, the called application will execute in the same process as the calling application. This means that when you use call runimage statement to start a new application, it can directly interact with the existing application by reading or writing from files or database tables. The OpenROAD documentation for call runimage statement explains how this direct communication occurs.\n* When using call system statement, the called application will execute in a separate process from the calling application. This means that when you use call system statement to start an application, it cannot directly interact with the existing application by reading or writing from files or database tables. The OpenROAD documentation for call system statement explains how indirect communication occurs between applications using different processes.\n* Call runimage statement is generally more efficient than using call system statement because it creates a new process for executing the application code. This means that there will be two separate processes running in parallel, one for the calling application and another for the called application. In contrast, when you use call system statement to start an application, the existing application and the started application run in the same process, which can result in poor performance due to memory overhead and CPU usage.\n* When using indirect communication, there is no direct communication method between applications. The caller cannot read or write from the files or database tables of the called application because they are running in different processes. For indirect communication, you can use a file that can be read by the other application or put data in a table that can be read in by the other application.\n* Call system statement is more suitable when the calling application has to wait for the response from the called application before continuing its execution. In such cases, it is essential to synchronize the communication between the two applications so that the caller does not move ahead until it gets a response from the callee.\nI hope this information helps you understand direct communication and indirect communication better in OpenROAD applications using call runimage statement and call system statement. Please let me know if I can provide any further assistance on this topic.'

If you specify systemcommand, the statement executes the command and returns automatically to the application. In the latter case the application can inquire the status of the executed command by using the CurSession.CallSystemStatus attribute.\n\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n'
2024-07-11T12:56:02 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nHere you go! Here are five instructions to help explain the concept of \'Call System Statement\' in OpenROAD Actian 4GL.\n1. Create a new session object in OpenROAD, call it mysession, and start it with a window:\n```\nmysession = CreateSession("mysession");\n```\n2. Call the system command to execute the command specified in cmdname field on the current form:\n```\ncall system cmdname;\n```\n3. Use the CurSession object\'s ProcessWindow attribute to determine whether the session has a window or not:\n```\nif (CurSession.ProcessWindow) then do:\n    //the session starts with a window\nelse:\n    //the session starts with a prompt\nend if;\n```\n4. Use the CurSession object\'s ProcessWait attribute to determine whether the session should wait for a system command to finish before resuming execution or not:\n```\nif (CurSession.ProcessWindow) then do:\n    //the session waits for a command to finish\nelse:\n    //the session continues immediately after starting the command\nend if;\n```\n5. Use the CurSession object\'s CallSystemStatus attribute to retrieve detailed status information on executed system commands:\n```\nmystatus = CurSession.CallSystemStatus;\n//mystatus contains the output of the system command\n```\nNote that CurSession is a special session variable representing the current session. You can use it in all your Actian 4GL code, like any other session object. For example, you can retrieve its ProcessWait attribute as shown in the third task above, or call its CallSystem method to execute a system command:\n```\ncall session.CallSystem("cmdname");\n```'
2024-07-11T12:57:15 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat is a call runimage statement?\n\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nA call runimage statement starts the OpenROAD application that runs in your desktop and displays the specified image file. The image can be displayed as the main application window or it can be displayed in a separate dialog box, depending on the setting of the CurSession.ProcessWindow attribute. The statement also passes command-line parameters to the application.\n\n'

Provide an example for each difference.\n\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nA call system statement calls a specified operating system command. For example, to start a new application or execute a utility program such as a calculator or word processor. On the other hand, a call runimage statement starts the OpenROAD application that runs in your desktop and displays the specified image file. The image can be displayed as the main application window or it can be displayed in a separate dialog box, depending on the setting of the CurSession.ProcessWindow attribute.\n'

2024-07-11T13:06:59 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat is the meaning of "Call System Statement" in this document?\n\n<|user|>\nThe statement calls the operating system from an application.\n\n<|assistant|>\nCan you elaborate on that statement?\n\n<|user|>\nSure! The statement can execute any operating system command and returns automatically to the application after starting the command. If CurSession.ProcessWait=FALSE, it immediately proceeds with execution of the following statements without waiting for the called command to finish. In such a case, if the command interferes with the operation of the calling application (for example, starts another application or changes the database), this may lead to unexpected outcomes. In that case setting CurSession.ProcessWait=TRUE is recommended to ensure that the calling application waits for the called command to finish before resuming execution.'
2024-07-11T13:08:45 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nCan you give an example of how to start a new OpenROAD application with the call system statement?\n\n<|user|>\nHere is an example:\n```\nCall system runimage "c:\\myapp.runimg";\n```\nIn this example, `c:\\myapp.runimg` specifies the file name of the image to be executed. The file name includes the path and extension. The command processor used in this case is the command processor for the Windows operating system. When you use the call system statement to start a new application, the new application inherits the environment variables that were available at the time of the call system statement invocation.\n\n'
