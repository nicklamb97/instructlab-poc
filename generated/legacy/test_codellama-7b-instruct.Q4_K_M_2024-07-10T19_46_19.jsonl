The syntax is decimal(p,s) where p is precision\nand s is scale. The minimum precision is 1, maximum precision is 39, and scale cannot exceed precision (can be 0).\n"}

Be cautious with data type conversions, especially with floating point numbers.\n2. Exact matches on floating point numbers are discouraged due to their approximate nature.\n3. Float and float4 are approximate numeric values, while integer and decimal are exact.\n4. The decimal data type is preferable for currency calculations where precision is crucial.\n5. Floating point numbers are stored in four or eight bytes, depending on the type and specified precision.\n"}
