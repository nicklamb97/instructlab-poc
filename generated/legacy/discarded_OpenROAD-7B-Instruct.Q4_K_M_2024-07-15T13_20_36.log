2024-07-15T14:06:08 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): " instructions\nHow do you set the background color of a window?\n** Input\nFor example, let's say we want to change the background color of our main application window.\n** Output\nTo accomplish this, use the next statement:\n```\nWINDOW -> MAIN APPLICATION WINDOW;\nBACKGROUND -> COLOR;\nB = #FFCC00;\nSET BGCOLOR TO B;\n```\nThis will set the background color of our main application window to the specified hexadecimal value (#FFCC00). The window reference should be valid and the property name should match with what you want to change. The statement also shows how to use variables in Actian 4GL, which can help you learn about this feature further.\n"
2024-07-15T14:06:08 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): " instructions\nWhat is the distinction between an enumerated type as well as a regular variable?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nEnumerated types are unique kinds of variables that can only hold values from a predefined set. These worths are called 'enumerators'. As an example, if you state an enumeration of cars with 4 possible worths:\n```\nCAR = ('BMW', 'Mercedes', 'Volvo', 'Saab');\n```\nThen only these 4 strings can be designated to the 'CAR' variable. Regular variables, on the various hand, can shop any kind of information, consisting of null worths and complicated structures like arrays or things.\n"
2024-07-15T14:06:08 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): " instructions\nHow do you produce a graph on a window?\n** Input\nFor instance, let's state we intend to produce a bar graph showing the sales of our items over the last year.\n** Output\nTo accomplish this, use the following statement:\n```\nGRAPHIC -> BAR;\nDATA -> SALES;\nYEARS -> LAST 12;\nSERIES -> 'Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C';\nBARS -> # OF BARS IN SERIES;\nX = FIELD(TITLE);\nX.LABEL = 'Sales';\n```\nThis will create a new bar graph on the window with the given title (X.LABEL). The graph will display sales data for up to 12 years, using 3 series of information: Product A, Product B and Product C. Each collection has its own set of bars that represent it (# OF BARS IN SERIES). The worth field (X) is used as the x-axis label for this graph.\n"

The food item should be noticeable and also the residential property name need to match with what you want to include in. The declaration additionally shows how to utilize variables in Actian 4GL, which can assist you find out concerning this feature further.\n"
2024-07-15T14:20:55 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nWe have developed a comprehensive library of functions and methods that allow you to perform various tasks with objects in Actian 4GL. These include:\n* Creating new objects (such as checking out a car or renting an apartment)\n* Manipulating existing objects (like changing their properties, moving them around, or deleting them)\n* Performing calculations on data within those objects (for example, figuring out someone's age from their birth date)\n* Generating random values for any property in the object\n* Comparing two objects for equality or difference\n* Converting between different types of data (such as strings to numbers or booleans to their corresponding values)\n* Accessing members of classes (like calling methods on objects or getting attributes from them)\n* Working with collections (like sorting them, finding specific items, or even including new ones into them)\n* And much more!\n\nWith this powerful toolset at your disposal, you can easily handle virtually any situation that may arise in your program. Just remember to always check the documentation for each function or method you use, as they all have detailed descriptions of their parameters and return values. This will help ensure you are using them correctly and avoiding potential errors or issues down the road.\n\n"

The audible property indicates that the alarm should make a sound when it goes off. You can also use this statement to set an alarm for a specific date:\n```\nALARM(title = 'Birthday Reminder')\n    .on(date = 2022-04-13)\n    .audible();\n```\nThis statement creates an alarm with the specified title and date. The on property specifies when the alarm should go off, such as April 13th of the year 2022. When the alarm goes off, it makes a sound to remind you of your birthday.\n"
2024-07-15T14:57:46 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nFor a set of 5 diverse task instructions, we can create them as follows:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should not have topic diversity. The list should follow the same topic and category.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction.\n8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.\n9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.\n\n\nTask 4:\n'

Once the sleep duration passes, the program resumes executing the remaining code in the else clause. This allows you to create delays or wait for certain events before continuing with your logic.\n'
