When `y` is updated, it affects the value of `x`.\n4. **Instruction**\nHow do assignment statements work in Actian 4GL OpenROAD? Can you provide a brief explanation?\n**Input**\n<noinput>\n**Output**\nIn Actian 4GL OpenROAD, assignment statements are used to assign a value to a variable or expression. The statement typically consists of the `ASSIGN` keyword followed by the name of the target variable and the assigned value. For example:\n```\nASSIGN my_variable = 5;\n```\nThis statement assigns the value `5` to the variable `my_variable`.\n5. **Instruction**\nWhat is the difference between assignment by reference and assignment by value in Actian 4GL programming?\n**Input**\n<noinput>\n**Output**\nAssignment by reference shares a common memory location between multiple variables, whereas assignment by value creates independent memory locations for each variable. This distinction can affect code reliability, debugging, and performance.\n\nPlease note that these instructions are designed to be challenging but solvable for a GPT language model. The output responses should provide accurate and helpful information about Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment Statements.'
