You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Explain in detail the difference between 'not default', 'with default', 'default', and 'defaultvalue'. Provide an example for each option.", "assistant": "*not default* is used to specify that a local variable or parameter has no initial value. When this clause is included, OpenROAD will not initialize the variable with any value. This clause is particularly useful when you need to create an array without an initial default value for all the elements. For example:\n**local myarray array of integer not default**\n*with default* specifies that the variable or parameter has a non-null literal assigned as its initial value. When this clause is included, OpenROAD will use the value provided in the 'default' clause to initialize the variable or parameter. This clause should be used for non-null data types only and cannot be used with null data types. For example:\n**local myinteger int with default 22**\n*default* specifies that a local variable or parameter has no initial value and its data type should be initialized as the appropriate system constant by default. For example:\n**local myinteger int with default null**\n*defaultvalue* is used to specify an explicit value for the initial default value of a local variable or parameter. When this clause is included, OpenROAD will use the literal provided in the 'defaultvalue' clause as its initial value for that variable or parameter. This clause can be used for non-null data types only and should not be used with null data types. For example:\n**local myinteger int defaultvalue 22**"}

If the data type of the local variable or parameter does not allow it, a syntax error is reported. For example: 'my_integer_var with default' will cause my_integer_var to be defined as having a default value (the current value) if it has no default value and is an integer type."}
