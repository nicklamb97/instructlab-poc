The function should not be named. It should take any type of number as its arguments, including integers or floating point numbers. The output value from the function can also be an integer or floating point number. This instruction is useful for performing simple calculations within your code, such as adding two numbers together or dividing one number by another.\n\n'

The instructions involve questions about various features of Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement, such as creating new records or accessing attributes of classes. The input fields contain no text because they do not require any specific context for their instructions. Instead, they simply provide a general example that can be used with the instruction. For example, when an instruction asks how to create a new record, the input field contains '<noinput>' which signifies there is no need for any additional information beyond what has been provided in the instruction itself. The outputs also follow this same structure by providing specific examples related to their instructions and inputs.\n\n"
