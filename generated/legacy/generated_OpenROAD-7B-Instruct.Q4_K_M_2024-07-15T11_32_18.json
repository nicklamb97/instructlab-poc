This is useful for building custom applications that require advanced data management features, such as reporting tools, analytics platforms, or IoT devices.\n- Graphics rendering: Provides high-level APIs for creating and managing visual content in your application, such as 2D and 3D graphics, textures, and animations. This is great for developing games, simulations, or any other application that requires rich visual experiences.\n- Network communication: Offers APIs for sending and receiving data over various networks (local or wide area), including TCP/IP protocols, HTTP/HTTPS requests, and WebSockets.

This allows you to create animations, handle asynchronous tasks such as network requests, or even schedule future actions. For example, if you want to fade out an image after 1 second, you could write:\nsleep(1000); // delay for 1 second\nimage.fadeOut();\nwhere \u20181000\u2019 represents the number of milliseconds (or thousandths of a minute) you want to wait before fading out the image. The sleep() function then pauses your script for the specified duration, after which it resumes normal execution and continues with any following statements.",

This statement returns the string 'Red' or 'Green', depending on which radio button was selected by the user. You can then use this information in your script however you like, such as setting another property or performing calculations based on it.",
