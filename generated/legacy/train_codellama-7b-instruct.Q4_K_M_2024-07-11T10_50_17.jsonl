The endloop statement must have the same label as the outermost loop being terminated (if any). It is usually placed after the control clause of the inner loop. If there are other loops nested within the terminating loop, all of them must be terminated using the endloop statement before control can return to the outer loop."}

(2 sentence long)", "assistant": "One potential issue is that if the label being passed does not correspond to the correct loop, this could result in unexpected behavior such as infinite loops or missing data. Additionally, it can be difficult to determine which label corresponds to the outer loop when there are multiple nested loops with identical labels."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How do you determine the outer loop when there are multiple nested loops with identical labels? (2 sentence long)", "assistant": "To determine the outer loop, one way is to add a counter variable that is incremented at the beginning of each iteration. The endloop statement can then be used to break out of both inner while loop containing the endloop statement and the outer while loop labeled “B” in which it is nested by using the label with the counter value."}

The syntax is:\nendloop [label];\n\nThe endloop statement then transfers control to the first statement following the terminated loop's endfor, end, or endwhile statement.\nHere is an example of how to terminate a for loop in Actian 4GL OpenROAD:\n```\nB:      for counter=1 to 10 do\n           /* statements */\n           if condition then\n                endloop B;\n           endif;\n        endfor\n```"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the difference between the continue and resume statements in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?", "assistant": "The continue statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD continues the loop, skips over all statements until the next iteration of the loop.\nThe resume statement also terminates the loop but returns control to the statement following the endloop statement. This allows you to terminate and start a different loop from where it was interrupted. For example:\n```\nB:    for counter=1 to 10 do\n       /* statements */\n        while condition2 do\n             /* statements */\n             if condition3 then\n                 resume B;\n             endif;\n        endwhile\nendfor\n```\nHere, the continue statement skips over all of the code until the next iteration. The resume statement terminates the inner loop and returns control to where the outer loop is interrupted. This allows you to start a new inner loop at the next counter value."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What are some scenarios where the endloop statement should be used in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?", "assistant": "Here are some scenarios where the endloop statement is commonly used:\n• To break out of nested loops. For example, if you have a nested while loop and need to terminate both loops, use endloop with the label for the inner loop followed by the outer loop.\n• To skip over a loop body when condition is false. You can use continue inside the loop instead. However, this is less efficient as it checks whether condition is true at each iteration of the loop whereas endloop checks condition only once.\n• To return control to a previous statement in the same loop. This is useful if you have multiple statements within a single while or for loop. For example, endloop can be used to skip over some statements and continue with others that are not related to the current iteration of the loop."}
