        "output": "To avoid repetition in a case statement, you can:\n1. Use switch statements instead of case statements to reduce repetition and code size. You should only use a case statement if there is no equivalent switch statement available for your programming language or the problem does not fit well with the switch structure.\n2. Instead of having multiple code blocks to execute for each possible condition, you can combine all these conditions into one block by using the nextcase statement inside the block or using the default keyword. You can nest Case Statements and execute multiple blocks based on conditions that are mutually exclusive.\n3. Define a separate class definition file with its unique object attributes and methods, then use these class definitions in the case statement to avoid repeating code for each object.\nExample of avoiding repetition:\nYou have defined five types of objects with different properties, but you need to perform the same action on all of them (you can't change their classes). You can create a separate class definition file for each type and use these class definitions in a case statement to avoid repeating code. Here is an example:\n```\ncase inputselection.Class of\n          SubForm : ...\n          CompositeField : ...\n          ...\nendcase;\n```\n4. Use default keyword if you have to execute the same block for multiple cases. This is useful when there are more than one value that falls into a single case or the cases do not overlap each other. You can also use the default statement alone without any valuelist, which will execute it for all values that do not match any of the previous valuelists.\nExample:\n```\ncase inputselection of\n     default : value = 0;\n     'one'   : value = 1;\n     'two'   : value = 2;\n     'three' : value = 3;\nendcase;\n```\nIn this example, the code will run for any value other than the specific values of one, two and three.|assistant|>",

The expression can be any valid OpenROAD data type.\n\nThis statement has the following syntax:\n\n```\ncase key of\n  valuelist: statement | beginendblock\n  {valuelist: statement | beginendblock}\nendcase;\n```\nA related statement is the nextcase statement (see Nextcase Statement), which is used to jump from the current statement to the beginning of the next statement block (this is the equivalent to the fall-through case in C). See the example.\n\nIn SQL statements '' and ' ' are evaluated equally, but in a 4GL case statement they are not.\n\n### Parameters--Case Statement\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n#### key\n\nSpecifies a constant expression or a variable reference\n\n#### valuelist\n\nSpecifies a single expression or a list of expressions of the same type as the `key` expression, separated by commas, or the keyword **default**\n\n#### statement\n\nSpecifies a single statement\n\n#### beginendblock\n\nSee BeginEndBlock.\n\n### Examples--Case Statement\n```\ncase inputselection of\n          'Beginner',\n          begin_synonym :\n          {\n               field(menu.edit_menu.paste).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               field(menu.file_menu.save_spec).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               curframe.WindowTitle = curframe.WindowTitle + 'Beginner';\n          }\n          'Intermediate',\n          inter_synonym :\n          {\n               field(menu.edit_menu.paste).curbias = MB_INVISIBLE;\n               /*\n               ** Do advanced stuff also.\n               */\n               nextcase;\n          }\n          'Advanced',\n          advance_synonym :\n          {\n               field(menu.file_menu.save_spec).curbias = MB_ENABLED;\n          }\n          default:\n               message 'Unknown selection' + inputselection + '!';\n          endcase;\n```\nNote several things about this example:\n\n- The value of the key expression and the valuelist elements need not be integers (in fact they can be any type of expression including floating point or string values), and they need not be constants (they can be simple variable references also).\n- To \"fall through\" from one case block to the next, you must explicitly say so in the code, or the code may have unintentional effects.\n- There can be only one default statement block in any case statement (it does not have to be at the end), and there does not have to be a default block.\n- If only a single statement is necessary to execute the code for a case, you do not have to use begin and end to bracket it, just code the statement. This can lead to briefer code:\n\n```\ncase lowercase(inputselection) of\n     default : value = 0;\n     'one'   : value = 1;\n     'two'   : value = 2;\n     'three' : value = 3;\nendcase;\n```\nThis type of construct is the equivalent of an array lookup using a string value as the index.\n\nOne of the most used multi-way branches in OpenROAD is to choose among a set of options based on the class of an object. This is coded as follows:\n\n```\nif obj.IsA(class = SubForm) = TRUE then\n          ...\nelseif obj.IsA(class = CompositeField) = TRUE then\n          ...\nelseif ...\n```\nBy using the attribute of an object called Class that returns a pointer to the class object of the object, and by using the case statement construct, this can be coded cleaner and executed faster as:\n```\ncase obj.Class of\n          SubForm : ...\n          CompositeField : ...\n          ...\nendcase;\n```"
