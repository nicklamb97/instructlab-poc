2024-07-12T16:48:37 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nI am trying to write a program in Actian 4GL that reads data from a CSV file. I need help with understanding how to use the FIELD() function and declare variables of different types. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!\n\nYou can assume the following for this task:\n- You have access to a CSV file containing the following fields:\n  - Title (string)\n  - Author (string)\n  - Genre (integer)\n- The title field is not null or empty.\n- The author field is not null or empty.\n- The genre field has a valid value between 1 and 7 inclusive.\n\nFor this task, you need to:\n- Declare three variables of the specified types:\n  - title (string) for the Title field.\n  - author (string) for the Author field.\n  - genre (integer) for the Genre field.\n- Read the values from the CSV file into these variables.\n- Perform any necessary conversions or validations on the data before storing it in memory.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, your program can use the variable references to access the data they contain. For example, you could display the title of the record using:\n```4gl\nDISPLAY (title);\n```\nOr you could perform actions based on the genre value, like:\n```4gl\nIF (genre = 2) THEN\n    DISPLAY ("This is a science fiction novel.");\nELSEIF (genre = 3) THEN\n    DISPLAY ("This is an adventure novel.");\nEND IF;\n```\nThese examples show how you can use the variables you declared to interact with the data they represent. The first example displays the title of the record, while the second performs an action based on its genre value. Both of these demonstrate how you can work with your variables to accomplish tasks related to reading and understanding the CSV file\'s contents.\n\nAfter completing this task, you will have learned how to use Actian 4GL\'s powerful features for manipulating data from various sources, such as databases or text files. This skill is essential when working with real-world applications that require complex logic and interactions between different types of information. By mastering these techniques in Actian 4GL, you can build more sophisticated programs that can handle a wide range of tasks and challenges.\n\nNow let\'s move on to the next task!\n'
