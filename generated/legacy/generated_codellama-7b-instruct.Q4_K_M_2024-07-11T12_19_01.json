For example, you might use this statement to set a variable that represents the employee number based on whether one was entered or not.\n* Control the flow of frames within an application based on the value in a status variable in the current frame.\n* Nest multiple if statements.\n* Perform different actions based on various conditions.

If-Then-Else Statement: This is the simplest form of a conditional statement and executes a group of statements if a condition is met, otherwise, it executes another set of statements. The else part can be omitted.\n2. ElseIf Statement: This is similar to the If-Then-Else statement but allows you to have multiple conditions for which different sets of statements will execute.\n3. Switch Case Statement: This is a more sophisticated conditional statement that works on a set of values instead of a single condition. It compares the value against a set of cases and executes a group of statements that corresponds to the case that matches the value.\n4. While Loop Statement: This is a statement that executes while a certain condition is true, otherwise it continues until a break statement is reached.\n5. Do-While Loop Statement: Similar to the while loop but instead of starting with the conditional check at the beginning, this statement starts executing the statements and then checks the condition at the end.\n6. For-Loop Statement: This statement allows you to repeat a group of statements while increasing a variable by a constant value or decreasing a variable by a constant value.\n7. Until Loop Statement: Similar to the while loop but instead of starting with the conditional check at the beginning, this statement starts executing the statements and then checks the condition at the end.",
