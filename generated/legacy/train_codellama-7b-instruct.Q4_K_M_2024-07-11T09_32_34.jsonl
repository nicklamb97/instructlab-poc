It provides readability but it also allows for\nsome flexibility in terms of code formatting, especially when combined with indentation. The begin/end keyword\nnotation, on the other hand, is more concise and easier to type, especially in situations where indentation is not\nsupported or is difficult to use. Both are acceptable coding styles and the choice ultimately depends on your \npreferences and preferences of the developers."}

In addition, the `begin {…} end` construct supports code completion and helps to improve readability in some editors, while the `{…}` construct is less flexible."}
