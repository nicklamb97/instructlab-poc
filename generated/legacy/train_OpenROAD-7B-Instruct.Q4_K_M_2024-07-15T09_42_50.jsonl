For example:\n\nIF isPremiumMember THEN\n    LET membershipStatus = \"Premium\"\nELSE\n    LET membershipStatus = \"Regular\"\nEND IF\n\nIn this case, the code checks the value of `isPremiumMember` variable and sets the `membershipStatus` accordingly."}

It takes a string \nrepresenting the C# source code as input and returns an equivalent Actian 4GL script. This allows you to easily integrate \nyour existing C# applications with OpenROAD and take advantage of its features, such as object-relational mapping (ORM), \ndynamic forms, and rule-based automation."}
