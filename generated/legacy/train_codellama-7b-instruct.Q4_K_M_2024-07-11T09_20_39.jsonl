This is useful when the order or types of parameters are not known beforehand and can be changed at runtime.\n* It does not require the creation of additional variables for parameters.\nHere are some examples:\n```\nPROCEDURE ProcName(Parameter1, ByRef Variable2)\n    PARAMETERS Parameter1, ByRef Variable2;\n    DISPLAY \"The value of the parameter is \", VARIABLE2.\nEND ProcName;\n```"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the purpose of Actian 4GL OpenROAD Unnamed Parameter List and when to use it?", "assistant": "Actian 4GL OpenROAD Unnamed Parameter List provides a way to pass parameters to procedures and methods without specifying their names. This feature allows for more flexibility in calling procedures and methods and can be useful in certain situations such as when working with dynamic data types or when the number of parameters is not known beforehand."}

Positional parameters - these are passed by position, for example, procedure(param1, param2, param3)\n2. Named parameters - these are passed by name, for example, procedure(name=param1, age=param2)\n3. Unnamed parameter list - this allows you to pass a series of values as arguments, for example, procedure(param1, param2, param3) byref(param1) byref(param2) byref(param3)"}

In SQL positional parameters are always expressions and they must match the data type required by the procedure or function definition."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What are some specific use cases for named parameters?", "assistant": "Some specific use cases for named parameters include using them when the parameter is not optional, or when a procedure or method requires a specific data type. Named parameters can also be used in procedures and methods where the order of the parameters is not known beforehand and can be changed at runtime."}
