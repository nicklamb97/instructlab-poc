This method guarantees that OpenROAD will find the component that you want, regardless of its location in the search order. It also allows you to organize your code more effectively, as you can put related functions into separate files and include them wherever needed.\n'

In dynamic frame resolution, OpenROAD searches for the frame first in the currently executing component (a frame, global procedure, or user class method script) and then in a global component if not found. In explicit frame resolution, OpenROAD searches for the frame based on the fixed search order.\n'

In explicit name resolution, on the other hand, OpenROAD uses the name space order as its search criteria. Dynamic name resolution is useful when you need to call a frame or procedure from another application or when the name of the frame or procedure is not known at compile time. Explicit name resolution is beneficial for predictable and consistent behavior.'

If not found, OpenROAD then searches for a global component (a frame or procedure). By default, the global search order for the resolution starts with the topmost running application, that is, the application with which the user began the session.\n\nOutput\nBy specifying a frame or procedure name at runtime using one of the mentioned statements, OpenROAD resolves the reference at runtime instead of at compile time.

Here are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n\n* Question: What are the main differences between dynamic and explicit name resolution?\n  * Answer: Dynamic name resolution occurs at runtime instead of at compile time, allowing a frame in an included application to call a frame that belongs to the including application. Explicit name resolution, on the other hand, uses the usual search order and does not allow for such flexibility.

This means that you can write more general code that is not tied to a specific application and then include it in multiple applications. This can lead to better code reusability because you do not have to duplicate code for each application.\n\n'

OpenROAD first searches the currently executing component (a frame, global procedure, or user class method script) for a local procedure with the dynamically specified name. If the search is not successful, OpenROAD then searches for a global component (a frame or procedure). This statement is used to open a specific frame for further processing or manipulation. On the other hand, the "callframe" statement is used to call a procedure within a frame and returns control to the calling program after the procedure completes its execution. The main difference between these two statements lies in their purpose: "openframe" statement opens a frame, while "callframe" statement calls a procedure within a frame.'
