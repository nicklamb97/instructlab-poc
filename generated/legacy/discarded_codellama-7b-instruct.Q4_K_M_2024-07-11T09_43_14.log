It supports advanced features like transparent object-relational mapping (ORM), automated object management, and integration with other Actian products like Actian Corp's data management platform, DataWorks. Using the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With clause can make the code less readable and maintainable as it overrides the frame properties for that specific call.

With clause provides a way to do this by specifying any attributes that you wish to set in the WITH clause. For example, suppose you are creating a new frame and you want to define an attribute called "customer_name" with a value of "John Smith." You can use the WITH clause to override the default attribute definition for the frame. The syntax for doing this is as follows:\n```\nCREATE FRAME customer (\n   customer_name = \'John Smith\'\n)\nWITH customer_name = \'Jane Doe\'\n;\n```\nIn this example, the WITH clause overrides the default value of "John Smith" with a new value of "Jane Doe".

It specifies a list of attributes whose values are overridden by those set in the With clause. Any unset attributes default to their values in the GhostExec or FrameExec object.\n\nTask 2: What are some common use cases for Actian 4GL OpenROAD frames that make use of With Clause?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: Some common use cases for Actian 4GL OpenROAD frames that make use of With clause include overring default properties of a frame or class, passing variables as arguments to a method call, and modifying the behavior of a frame\'s initialization routine. For example, you can override the default display width and height of a text window by specifying the WITH clause attribute WIDTH=<WIDTH>, where <WIDTH> is an integer representing the desired width.\n\nTask 3: What are some examples of valid Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause attributes?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: Some valid Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause attributes include TITLE=<title>, where <title> is a string that sets the title of the frame, and WIDTH=<width>, where <width> is an integer that sets the width of the window in pixels.\n\nTask 4: What is the syntax for using Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: The syntax for using Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause is as follows: WITH *attribute* = *expression*{, *attribute* = *expression*} where *attribute* specifies any attribute that you can set for the GhostExec or FrameExec object, and *expression* is any legal expression that evaluates to the appropriate data type.\n\nTask 5: Explain how Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause interacts with Actian 4GL OpenROAD variables.\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: The WITH clause interacts with Actian 4GL OpenROAD variables in a similar way as it does with attributes found in the GhostExec or FrameExec objects that define a frame. When an expression is evaluated using With Clause, any variable references are resolved to the values of the corresponding variables in the calling frame\'s context before evaluation of the With clause expression continues.\n\nI hope this helps.

Can you provide me with a more concrete example?\n\n<|assistant|>\nOf course, I\'d be happy to give an example! Imagine that you have a frame called "MyFrame" and it has 4 attributes: MyAttribute1, MyAttribute2, MyAttribute3, and MyAttribute4. If you call the frame in your program without using the WITH clause, the values of these attributes are retrieved from the database program itself. However, if you use the WITH clause and set one or more attributes to a different value for that specific call, then the new values will be used instead of the ones stored within the database program itself.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```sql\n-- Call the MyFrame frame without using the WITH clause\nCALL MyFrame;\n\n-- Output:\nMyAttribute1 = 5\nMyAttribute2 = 10\nMyAttribute3 = 15\nMyAttribute4 = 20\n\n-- Now call the MyFrame frame with a new value for MyAttribute1\nWITH MyAttribute1 = 7 CALL MyFrame;\n\n-- Output:\nMyAttribute1 = 7\nMyAttribute2 = 10\nMyAttribute3 = 15\nMyAttribute4 = 20\n```\n\nIn this example, you can see that the attributes retrieved from the database program itself for the first call. However, when calling the frame with the WITH clause, you have specified a new value (7) for MyAttribute1 instead of using the original value (5) from the database program itself. This means that the values used in the second output are different than those used in the first output because we specifically set one attribute to a different value during execution.\n\n'

2024-07-11T12:28:57 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nWhat is the purpose of the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause?\n** Output\nThe Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause is used to override the called frame's original definition, specifying a list of attributes in the GhostExec or FrameExec definition.\n"
2024-07-11T12:28:57 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nWhat are the attributes that you can set with the Actian 4GL OpenROAD With Clause?\n** Output\nThe 'With Clause' in Actian 4GL OpenROAD allows you to set any of the following attributes:\n* The **Active** attribute\n* The **Command** attribute\n* The **Environment** attribute\n* The **ExitOnError** attribute\n* The **Flags** attribute\n* The **Message** attribute\n* The **Parameters** attribute\n* The **Results** attribute\n* The **Sleep** attribute\n"
2024-07-11T12:28:57 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat are the attributes that you can set for the GhostExec or FrameExec class?\n** Output\nAny attributes that you do not set default to the values they have in the GhostExec or FrameExec object. Any attributes that you set are valid only for that instance of the frame. This element has the following syntax:\n\nWITH *attribute* = *expression*, *attribute* = *expression*,...\n'
