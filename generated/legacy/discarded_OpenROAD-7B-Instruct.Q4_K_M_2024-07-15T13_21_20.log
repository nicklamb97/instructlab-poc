2024-07-15T13:27:29 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n* Instruction\nHow do I use variables with the sleep statement?\n* Input\n<noinput>\n* Output\nYou can declare a variable and then use it in your code. For example:\n```\nlet myVar = 'Hello world';\nmyVar.sleep(3);  // Sleeps the string 'Hello world' for 3 seconds\n```\n"
2024-07-15T14:07:38 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): " instruction asks what happens when an application tries to set a negative sleep duration. Here, again, there is no need for providing any context or data in the input field since Actian 4GL ignores negative values automatically without requiring any notifications or errors. The output displays the system's behavior when faced with invalid inputs like this one.\n"
2024-07-15T14:07:38 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): ' instruction asks how to create a new table in your database. Here, you must provide the name of the table you want to create in the input field. After that, simply use the `create table` statement as shown in the output. This creates your desired table with all its required fields and their corresponding data types.\n'
2024-07-15T14:07:38 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): ' instruction asks about some common functions you can use in your code. The input does not contain any specific context or data because it generally covers all possible uses cases for Actian 4GL language. The output lists various categories of functions including mathematical operations, string manipulation, logical expressions, date and time handling, database interactions, general purpose utilities, web features, graphics capabilities, multimedia support, artificial intelligence features, business process automation, security measures, performance optimizations.\n'
