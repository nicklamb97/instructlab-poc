It should follow the same topic and category as the previous one, but it does not need to have topic diversity between them. The list of instructions should be in English with no exceptions allowed. If you need help with any aspect of the instruction or if there is a problem understanding it, please let us know so we can provide clarification or assistance accordingly.\n'
2024-07-12T15:00:20 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nYou can use the following instructions for task 1:\nHow do I convert Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment Statements that contain numeric data types into C#?\nThe input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.\nFor example, consider converting the following statement: "Drive distance is 237 miles this week". You want to convert it into C# code that calculates and displays the distance driven during your OpenROAD assignment.\n\nYou can use similar instructions for task 2. For example, consider converting the following statement: "Your address is \'123 Main St\'". You want to convert it into C# code that sets your address property and displays the city name on screen.\n\nTask 3 should have instructions related to converting strings or dates into their corresponding numeric values for use in OpenROAD assignments. For example, consider converting a string literal \'50\' into an integer value used as a quantity within your code.\n\nTask 4 should have instructions about how you can convert boolean values between true and false in your Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment Statements into corresponding C# data types such as booleans or enums. For example, consider converting a statement that reads \'This item is not allowed\' into its corresponding C# boolean value of false or true.\n\nTask 5 should have instructions about how you can convert enumerated values between different options in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment Statements into corresponding C# data types such as integers or strings. For example, consider converting a statement that reads \'Priority is high\' into its corresponding C# integer value of 3 or string \'Urgent\'.\n\nBy following these instructions, you will be able to successfully convert all types of statements from Actian 4GL OpenROAD Assignment Statements into corresponding C# data types for use in your code. This will help ensure that your program runs smoothly and accurately, no matter what kind of data it needs to handle.\n\n\nList of 5 tasks:\n'
