Here's an overview of the supported operators:\n\n### Arithmetic Operators\n\nArithmetic operators combine numeric expressions into new expressions. They are:\n\n- `+`: Addition\n- `-`: Subtraction\n- `*`: Multiplication\n- `/`: Division\n- `**`: Exponentiation\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nnum_days = num_days + 30;\narea = pi * r**2;\n```\n\nOpenROAD also supports date arithmetic:\n\n```\nstart_date = start_date + '2 days';\n```\n\n#### Operator Precedence (highest to lowest):\n\n1. `**`\n2. `*`, `/`\n3. `+`, `-`\n\nOperators with equal precedence are processed from left to right. Use parentheses to force alternate precedence.\n\n### String Operator\n\nThe concatenation operator (`+`) joins string expressions:\n\n```\nanswer = prompt 'Please enter department for ' + name + ': ';\n```\n\n### Logical Operators\n\nLogical operators (AND, OR, NOT) join logical expressions into new boolean expressions.\n\n#### Truth Tables:\n\n**AND:**\n- True AND True = True\n- True AND False = False\n- True AND Null = Null\n- False AND False = False\n- False AND Null = False\n- Null AND Null = Null\n\n**OR:**\n- True OR True/False/Null = True\n- False OR True = True\n- False OR False = False\n- False OR Null = Null\n- Null OR Null = Null\n\n**NOT:**\n- NOT True = False\n- NOT False = True\n- NOT Null = Null\n\n#### Precedence (highest to lowest):\n\n1. NOT\n2. AND\n3. OR\n\nUse parentheses to change the order of evaluation.\n\n### Comparison (Boolean) Operators\n\nThese operators yield boolean values (TRUE, FALSE, or null with nullable expressions):\n\n- `=`: Equal to\n- `!=`, `<>`, `^=`: Not equal to\n- `<`: Less than\n- `<=`: Less than or equal to\n- `>`: Greater than\n- `>=`: Greater than or equal to\n- `is null`: Value is null\n- `is not null`: Value is other than null\n- `like`: Value matches a pattern-matching string\n- `not like`: Value doesn't match a pattern-matching string\n\n### Like Operator and Pattern Matching\n\nThe `like` operator compares two strings for resemblance. Syntax:\n\n```\ncharvar [not] like pattern [escape escapechar]\n```\n\nSpecial characters in the pattern:\n- `_`: Matches any single character\n- `%`: Matches any string of characters, regardless of length\n- `[]`: Matches any character within the brackets (when preceded by escape character)\n\n### Is [Not] Null Operator\n\nTests whether an expression is null. Syntax:\n\n```\nexpression is [not] null\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\nif salary is null then\n    sal_msg = 'Salary amount is unknown.'\nendif;\n```"

        "output": "In OpenROAD, you can concatenate string expressions using `+`. This allows you to easily construct longer strings by combining parts of strings. Here are some examples:\n```\nanswer = prompt 'Please enter department for ' + name + ': ';\n```\nThe syntax is straightforward and easy to use. It also differs from other programming languages in that it doesn't require the `+` operator be placed between two string expressions; you can just use a single expression to join strings together, making it easier to write more natural-looking code.\n\nFor example:\n```\nanswer = prompt 'Please enter department for ' name ': ';\n```",

            "## Operators in OpenROAD\n\nOpenROAD supports various types of operators for different operations. Here's an overview of the supported operators:\n\n### Arithmetic Operators\n\nArithmetic operators combine numeric expressions into new expressions. They are:\n\n- `+`: Addition\n- `-`: Subtraction\n- `*`: Multiplication\n- `/`: Division\n- `**`: Exponentiation\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nnum_days = num_days + 30;\narea = pi * r**2;\n```\n\nOpenROAD also supports date arithmetic:\n\n```\nstart_date = start_date + '2 days';\n```\n\n#### Operator Precedence (highest to lowest):\n\n1. `**`\n2. `*`, `/`\n3. `+`, `-`\n\nOperators with equal precedence are processed from left to right. Use parentheses to force alternate precedence.\n\n### String Operator\n\nThe concatenation operator (`+`) joins string expressions:\n\n```\nanswer = prompt 'Please enter department for ' + name + ': ';\n```\n\n### Logical Operators\n\nLogical operators (AND, OR, NOT) join logical expressions into new boolean expressions.\n\n#### Truth Tables:\n\n**AND:**\n- True AND True = True\n- True AND False = False\n- True AND Null = Null\n- False AND False = False\n- False AND Null = False\n- Null AND Null = Null\n\n**OR:**\n- True OR True/False/Null = True\n- False OR True = True\n- False OR False = False\n- False OR Null = Null\n- Null OR Null = Null\n\n**NOT:**\n- NOT True = False\n- NOT False = True\n- NOT Null = Null\n\n#### Precedence (highest to lowest):\n\n1. NOT\n2. AND\n3. OR\n\nUse parentheses to change the order of evaluation.\n\n### Comparison (Boolean) Operators\n\nThese operators yield boolean values (TRUE, FALSE, or null with nullable expressions):\n\n- `=`: Equal to\n- `!=`, `<>`, `^=`: Not equal to\n- `<`: Less than\n- `<=`: Less than or equal to\n- `>`: Greater than\n- `>=`: Greater than or equal to\n- `is null`: Value is null\n- `is not null`: Value is other than null\n- `like`: Value matches a pattern-matching string\n- `not like`: Value doesn't match a pattern-matching string\n\n### Like Operator and Pattern Matching\n\nThe `like` operator compares two strings for resemblance. Syntax:\n\n```\ncharvar [not] like pattern [escape escapechar]\n```\n\nSpecial characters in the pattern:\n- `_`: Matches any single character\n- `%`: Matches any string of characters, regardless of length\n- `[]`: Matches any character within the brackets (when preceded by escape character)\n\n### Is [Not] Null Operator\n\nTests whether an expression is null. Syntax:\n\n```\nexpression is [not] null\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\nif salary is null then\n    sal_msg = 'Salary amount is unknown.'\nendif;\n```"
