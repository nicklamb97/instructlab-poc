These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should have topic diversity. The list should follow different topics and categories.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.\n8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.\n9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.

However, I can help you with your programming tasks by providing advice and assisting you in completing your code. Here is an example of how I can assist you:\nSuppose you want to create a function that calculates the area of a circle given its radius. You could write the following code:\n```\nfunction calculate_circle_area(radius) is \n  local pi = 3.1415926;  \n  return pi * radius^2;\nend;\n```\nIn this example, I have provided you with a simple function that takes in a radius variable and returns its area as an output. You can call this function from anywhere in your Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement or from other programs you are working on. The syntax is similar to what you would use when defining variables or creating methods in your code, so it should be easy for you to understand and use.\n'

The above example demonstrates how to remove records from tables, but it works equally well for any other type of data storage system in Actian 4GL OpenROAD For Statement.\n"
