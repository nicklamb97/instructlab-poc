2024-07-15T15:51:42 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nYou are asked to come up with a set of 5 diverse task instructions under the compositional_skills->programming_languages->actian_4gl->procedure_statement for the task "Write Actian 4GL OpenROAD Procedure Statements". These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should have topic diversity. The list should follow different topics and categories.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. You should generate appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders.\n8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.\n9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.\n\n\nList of 5 tasks:\n'

You can set the initial value of an attribute when you declare it like this:\n```\nattribute name = 'value';\n```\nFor example, to declare a string attribute called 'title' with its default value 'Mr.', you would use the following code:\n```\ntitle = 'Mr.';\n```\nYou can also set the default value of an attribute to null like this:\n```\nname = null;\n```\nFor attributes that are not object-typed, you can specify the data type using the 'type' clause like this:\n```\ntype (name) = integer;\n```\nwhere 'integer' is the name of the data type. This tells Actian 4GL that the attribute should hold integers as its value. For example, if you want to declare a numeric field called 'age', you would use the following code:\n```\ntype (age) = integer;\n```\n***************************\n\nTask 4\n** Instruction\nWhat are some common methods you can call on an OpenROAD Procedure Statement?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nSome common methods that you can call on a procedure like this include the following:\n- create (parameters)\n- destroy ()\n- modify (parameters)\nThese methods allow you to perform various actions on the procedure, such as creating it with specified attributes, destroying it and its data, or modifying its attributes. You can use code similar to this to call these methods in your program:\n```\nprocedure = create ('title' = 'My Procedure', description = 'A detailed description');\nprocedure.modify (attribute 'color' = red);\nprocedure.destroy ();\n```\n"

It also assumes that your code runs within an open window or dialog box. However, it generally works for other types of visual content such as text fields, menus, or checkboxes. Just make sure to specify the right property name when referencing your visual content.\n']
