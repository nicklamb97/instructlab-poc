It is enclosed in square brackets, indicating it's optional.\n2) Yes, in Actian 4GL the return type of a local procedure can be specified.\n3) The return type of a local procedure can be specified using the **returning** keyword followed by an Actian 4GL data type. For example:\n   **localprocname** = procedure returning typewithoutdefault;\n4) The following are valid data types for a local procedure's return type in Actian 4GL:\n* Actian 4GL data types\n* Numeric and date-time data types\n* Character string data types\n5) To specify that a local procedure has no return type, the **none** keyword can be used. It is enclosed in square brackets, indicating it's optional. For example:\n   **localprocname** = procedure returning none;\n6) Can the name of a local procedure contain spaces?\n7) How does Actian 4GL handle errors when executing a local procedure with no return type?\n8) What happens if multiple LocalProcedureDeclarations have the same name in a single script?\n<|assistant|>\n1) No, the name of a local procedure cannot contain spaces. The local procedure's identifier is used to access the local procedure within its own definition and its invocation by other parts of the script.\n2) Yes, Actian 4GL handles errors when executing a local procedure with no return type by returning an error message. For example:\n   ERROR 1059: A local procedure with no return type must have an output statement to prevent unexpected results from occurring in other parts of the script.\n3) In this situation, Actian 4GL raises an error because multiple LocalProcedureDeclarations with the same name cannot be distinguished by the local procedure's identifier. Each declaration would require a unique identifier.\n4) No, Actian 4GL does not have a built-in data type for storing a function that returns no value.\n5) To specify that a local procedure has no return type, use LocalProcedureDeclaration syntax as shown in the following example:\n   **localprocname** = procedure returning none;\n6) No, you cannot access a local procedure's invocation result if it doesn't have any output statements. This is because the result of a local procedure with no return type is unpredictable and depends on the statements within its definition.\n7) In this situation, Actian 4GL raises an error because the invocation of such a local procedure would have unexpected results and could cause problems in other parts of the script.\n8) No, in Actian 4GL, a single script can contain multiple LocalProcedureDeclarations with the same name as long as they are defined within different scopes (e.g., local procedure definitions nested within each other).\n<|user|>"

2024-07-10T14:53:56 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nWhat are some differences between LocalProcedureDeclaration and GlobalProcedureDeclaration?\n<|system|>\nYou can compare a local procedure declaration to a global procedure declaration in several ways:\n1. Scope - A local procedure can only be accessed from within the script where it is defined, whereas a global procedure can be accessed from anywhere within the Actian 4GL application.\n2. Lifetime - Local procedures are defined within a scope and exist only as long as that scope exists. Global procedures, on the other hand, exist throughout the life of the Actian 4GL application.\n3. Return value - Local procedures can return any type of variable, while global procedures must return a type that is compatible with the default return value of the script. If this requirement cannot be met, the procedure will not compile. Global procedures do not have to specify a return value when declared.\n4. Parameters - Local procedures can accept parameters as input just like any other procedure. Global procedures have no such feature because they exist outside of the scope where the procedure is defined.\n<|assistant|>\nCan local procedures be used with dynamic SQL in Actian 4GL?\n<|system|>\nYes, local procedures can be used with dynamic SQL in Actian 4GL. The LocalProcedureDeclaration element can specify a dynamic SQL statement as part of the procedure declaration, and when executed, it will compile into an internal Actian 4GL command that will be executed at runtime. This allows for code reuse without having to duplicate logic multiple times.\n<|assistant|>\nCan local procedures have a return value in Actian 4GL?\n<|system|>\nYes, local procedures can have a return value specified within the LocalProcedureDeclaration element. If no type is specified, the procedure will implicitly return the default return value of the script. When a non-default type is specified as part of the procedure declaration, it must be compatible with the default return value of the script.\n<|assistant|>\nHow can you determine if a procedure in Actian 4GL has been declared?\n<|system|>\nYou can check to see if a procedure has been defined by using either of the following methods:\n1. Search for the procedure name within the script or any external include files that are referenced by the script.\n2. Use the command **select procname from sysprocs where type = 'proc'** to get the list of procedures defined in the application. The output will show the procedure names and whether they are local or global."

In addition to the basic syntax, the local procedure declaration has an additional attribute named returning which specifies whether the procedure returns a value. In contrast, the procedure declaration does not have such an attribute, and therefore is used for defining procedures that do not return a value.\n3) What is the difference between **returning none** and **none** in LocalProcedureDeclaration?\nNone indicates no return type for the local procedure, whereas returning none specifies that this local procedure does not have a return value.\n\n<|system|>\nYour model successfully completes all 5 tasks within the given requirements.

On the other hand, LocalProcedureDeclaration only declares the local procedure to be used within the same script.\nTask 12: How can we use LocalProcedureDeclaration to make the code more organized and easier to read?\nAnswer: LocalProcedureDeclaration can help to organize and improve the code by making it more modular. By breaking down a complex task into smaller procedures, it is easier to understand how each procedure works and what its input and output are. Additionally, if an error occurs in one procedure, it will not affect other procedures, as long as the local procedure declaration has been followed.'

If the keyword **none** is used, the type can be omitted as it is assumed that there is no return value.\nHere is an example:\n**localprocname = procedure returning string;** localprocname = procedure;\n** Output\nThis line defines a local procedure named 'localprocname' which returns a string type. You can use this procedure to perform any operation that has a string as its return type, such as a query or an expression.\nHere is another example:\n**localprocname = procedure returning none;** localprocname = procedure;\n** Output\nThis line defines a local procedure named 'localprocname' which returns no value, meaning it does not have any return value. You can use this procedure to perform any operation that does not produce a value or has an undefined return type.\nHere is one more example:\n**localprocname = procedure returning decimal;** localprocname = procedure;\n** Output\nThis line defines a local procedure named 'localprocname' which returns a decimal type, meaning it can be used to perform any operation that has a decimal return value, such as a calculation or an expression.\n"

I may ask questions about your instructions later on in case of any uncertainty.\nHere is my first task:\nTask 1\nWhat is the difference between a local procedure and a global procedure?\nInstructions:\nExplain the concept of local procedures and global procedures in Actian 4GL. Also, explain how they differ from each other. Please use the examples given below to illustrate your point.\nExamples:\n* A **global procedure** is defined within the program scope whereas a **local procedure** is defined within the script scope.\n* A **global procedure** can be invoked by multiple scripts in the same program. In contrast, a local procedure can only be used in the script where it was declared.\n* A **global procedure** has visibility throughout the program. The local procedure declaration within a script also allows the access of variables defined in that script.\n\nPlease provide your answer for the task below:\n|>'

2024-07-10T17:00:07 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nThe return type of a local procedure declaration can be defined using **returning** *typewithoutdefault* or **none**. The former specifies a built-in data type or user-defined data type, whereas the latter indicates that there is no return value. A local procedure declaration does not have a return statement. Instead, it returns a value when its associated procedure invokes itself recursively and eventually reaches the end of the program flow.\n'
