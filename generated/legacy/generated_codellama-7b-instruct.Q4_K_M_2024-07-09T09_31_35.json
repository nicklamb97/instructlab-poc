For example:\n\n```\n//insert into employees(salary, age)\n//values(:salfield, :agefield);\n//commit work;\n```\n\n## Block comments\n\nSingle-line or multi-line comments can be included in a comment block. A comment block begins with \"/*\" on the left, ends with \"*/\". For example, the following is a single-line block comment:\n\n```\n/* This is a single-line block comment */\n```\n\nThe following is a block comment that spans multiple lines:\n\n```\n/*\n** This is a multi-line block\n** comment.\n*/\n```\n\nBlock comments may also be used at the end of a line:\n\n```\ninsert into employees(salary, age)\nvalues(:salfield, :agefield); /*This is a comment*/\ncommit work;\n```\n\n**Note:** You cannot nest comments."

Use comments to document functions, variables, and other important elements in your code.
