2024-07-15T14:18:10 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nYou are asked to come up with a set of 5 diverse task instructions under compositional_skills->programming_languages->actian_4gl->sleep_statement for the task "Explain the sleep statement in Actian 4GL and its usage in application development.". These task instructions will be given to an open AI language model such as GPT. The GPT model should complete all tasks successfully without any errors or warnings.\n\nHere are the requirements for this task:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should not have topic diversity. The list should follow the same topic and category.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. You should generate appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.\n8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.\n9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words.\n\n\nList of 5 tasks:\n'

For example, if you want to know how fast your car is going, you could use this code:\n```\nmyCar = new Car('Volvo');   // Creates a car object\nspeed = myCar.property('speed');  // Gets the 'speed' property from the car\nconsole.log(speed);             // Displays its current speed (in miles per hour) in the console\n```\n* Method name - Calls a method on the object with the given name. For example, if you want to change your car's color, you could use this code:\n```\nmyCar = new Car('Volvo');   // Creates a car object\nmyCar.method('changeColor')();  // Calls its 'changeColor' method (which sets a new color)\nconsole.log(myCar.color);     // Displays the new color in the console\n```\n* Field name - Returns the value of the field specified by its name. For example, if you want to know what kind of radio your car has, you could use this code:\n```\nmyCar = new Car('Volvo');   // Creates a car object\nconsole.log(myCar.field('radioType'));  // Displays the type of radio (AM/FM or Satellite) in the console\n```\n* Enum value - Returns the value of the enumerated variable specified by its name. For example, if you want to know which gear your car is in, you could use this code:\n```\nmyCar = new Car('Volvo');   // Creates a car object\nconsole.log(myCar.enumValue('gear'));  // Displays the current gear (1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th) in the console\n```\n* Array index - Returns the value at the given index in the array. For example, if you want to know which songs are playing on your car stereo, you could use this code:\n```\nmyCar = new Car('Volvo');   // Creates a car object\nmyCar.property('stereo').array['songs'];  // Gets the 'songs' property from the car's stereo\nconsole.log(myCar.property('stereo').array['index']);  // Displays the current song being played (its title and artist) in the console\n```\nBy understanding these functions, you can manipulate objects and their properties more easily and write more efficient code!\n"
