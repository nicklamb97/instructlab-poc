In this case, we set the value of \n`membershipStatus` to \"Regular\". This happens when the person is not a premium member, such as a standard or basic \nmember. The conditional expression checks if they have any privileges associated with being a premium member, and if not, \nit sets their membership status to \"Regular\"."}
