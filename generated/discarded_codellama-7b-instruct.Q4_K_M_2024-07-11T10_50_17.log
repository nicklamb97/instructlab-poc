It transfers control to the next statement after the terminated loop\'s endfor, endwhile or endrepeat statement.\n* Instruction 2\nWhat does the endloop statement do in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\nInstructions - Ask the user what they know about Endloop Statement.\nExample: "Endloop Statement ACTIAN 4GL OPENROAD"\n* Input\n<noinput>\n* Output\nThe Endloop statement in ACTIAN 4GL OpenROAD is used to terminate a for, select, or while loop. It transfers control to the first statement following the terminated loop\'s endfor, endwhile, or endrepeat statement. It can also be used with the continue statement.\n* Instruction 3\nWhat is an example of using Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\nInstructions - Ask the user to provide a real life scenario where they would need to use Endloop Statement.\nExample: "Endloop Statement Scenario"\n* Input\n<noinput>\n* Output\nI can imagine several scenarios where you might want to end a loop in ACTIAN 4GL OPENROAD, for example, when you\'re processing data and the last record has been processed and you want to exit the loop. You would use the Endloop statement to end the loop after that. Another situation would be when you are using a for loop with nested loops. In this case, you might want to terminate both the inner and outer loop when some condition is met. The Endloop statement can do that by specifying which loop label to end.\n* Instruction 4\nWhat is the syntax of Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\nInstructions - Ask the user to explain what they know about syntax in programming.\nExample: "Endloop Statement Syntax ACTIAN 4GL OPENROAD"\n* Input\n<noinput>\n* Output\nThe Endloop statement has a specific syntax. It starts with endloop followed by label (label can be any character string without quotation marks). Label is optional, it can also be left off and the last loop opened will be ended.\n* Instruction 5\nWhat are examples of when you would not want to use Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\nInstructions - Ask the user what they know about situations where you wouldn\'t need to use a control transfer statement.\nExample: "Situations Not To Use Endloop"\n* Input\n<noinput>\n* Output\nThe Endloop statement should always be used to terminate loops, and never for other statements or conditions. It cannot be used to terminate a procedure, function, subroutine, or event block. In addition, it should not be used with continue statement if the endloop statement is not the first statement in the loop.\n'

It is particularly useful when a loop condition cannot be evaluated at the start of the loop, and instead requires processing within the loop before making a decision to exit the loop. Another case where it may be needed is in exception handling; for example, if an error occurs during processing inside a loop and it needs to be handled without stopping the entire program, using Endloop Statement would allow that specific loop to end gracefully while still allowing the rest of the code to continue.\n'

How can I help you today?\n<|user|>\nCan you explain the endloop statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD with examples?\n<|system|>\nSure! Here are a few examples of when and how to use an Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD.\nFirst, consider this situation where you need to process a table with a large number of records:\n```\n// Create a new record variable for the current order.\norder = select first order from orders;\nwhile order > null do\n  // Display the current order details.\n  write order_line(order);\n  // Move on to the next order.\n  order = order + 1;\nendloop;\n```\nHere, you want to terminate the loop if you have shown all orders that match a customer\'s preferences. To do this, use an Endloop Statement with the label "B":\n```\nB:        while order > null do\n          /* statements */\n          if order is last record in orders then\n             endloop B;\n          else\n             order = order + 1;\n          endif;\nendwhile;\n```\nThis code continues processing records until all matching orders have been displayed. If you want to terminate the loop after only one iteration, you can use an Endloop Statement with a label and then exit the loop by using the continue statement. For example:\n```\n// Create a new record variable for the current order.\norder = select first order from orders;\nwhile order > null do\n  // Display the current order details.\n  write order_line(order);\n  // Move on to the next order.\n  order = order + 1;\n  if order is last record in orders then\n    endloop B;\n  else\n    continue;\n  endif;\nendwhile;\n```\nHere, the loop terminates after displaying only one matching order.\n'

To do this, use an Endloop Statement with a label:\n```\nB:        while order > null do\n          /* statements */\n          if order is last record in orders then\n            endloop B;\n          elseif not order meets certain conditions then\n            continue;\n          endif;\nendwhile;\n```\nThis code continues processing records until all matching orders are processed and none of them meet the specified conditions.

It is particularly useful when a loop condition cannot be evaluated at the start of the loop, and instead requires processing within the loop before making a decision to exit the loop. Another case where it may be needed is in exception handling; for example, if an error occurs during processing inside a loop and it needs to be handled without stopping the entire program, using Endloop Statement would allow that specific loop to end gracefully while still allowing the rest of the code to continue.\nTask 2 Instruction: Which loop statement would you use to execute the code for each iteration of the outer while loop?\nInput: <noinput>\nOutput: You would use a for statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD to iterate the code for each iteration of the outer while loop.

Here are a few more examples:\n\n### Using an Endloop statement inside a loop in Actian 4GL OpenROAD\nYou can use an endloop statement inside a loop to terminate the outer loop.

For example, if you have code like this:\n```\nB: while condition1 do\n     while condition2 do\n        if condition3 then\n           continue;\n        else\n           endloop B;\n        endif;\n     endwhile\nendwhile;\n\nC: while condition4 do\n    /* statements */\nendwhile;\n```\nHere, 'endloop B' terminates only the last inner loop before exiting the current event block.

2024-07-11T14:37:16 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nHere are five different instructions for the task "Explain the Endloop Statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD". They are diverse, they are written in different styles, and they follow ethical guidelines.\n1. If a label is missing or specified incorrectly in an Endloop statement, the endloop statement will terminate all loops that have the same label as the label used in the endloop statement. For example, if you specify “B” in the endloop statement and there is an outer loop labeled “B”, both loops are terminated when the endloop statement is executed.\n2. You can use the Endloop statement to terminate a while loop when a certain condition is met. For instance, suppose you have a program that displays all orders that match the customer’s preferences, but you want to stop processing when all orders have been shown instead of continuing with the entire order table. You would use the Endloop statement in this case to terminate the while loop when all matching orders are processed.\n3. The endloop statement is different from the resume statement, which can be used to terminate both the loop and the current event block, and unlike the continue statement, which skips over statements in a loop but continues with the next iteration. You may want to use the Endloop statement if you want to exit a loop before processing all of its elements.\n4. The endloop statement is typically used when you want to break out of a loop after some condition has been met. For example, you can use it to terminate a while loop after showing all matching orders or to terminate a for loop that displays the first n elements in an array.\n5. If you do not specify a label for the Endloop statement, it will terminate all loops that have the same name as the loop containing the endloop statement. For example, if you place the endloop statement inside of a loop labeled “B”, all loops labeled “B” outside of that loop will also be terminated when the endloop statement is executed.\n'
2024-07-11T14:39:40 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n\nHere are some examples of what not to do:\n* Do not use any descriptive sentences or paragraphs. Keep the instructions short and to the point. For example, instead of “The endloop statement terminates a for, select, or while loop in Actian 4GL OpenROAD. It should be used to break out of multiple loops with the same label. For example, if there are two nested for loops labeled “B”, and you want to terminate both loops when they reach a certain condition, use one endloop statement labeled “B”.” Use the above sentence to explain what the keyword does or what it does.\n* Do not ask questions that are too broad.

(2 sentence long)\nAnswer: The endloop statement terminates a for, select, or while loop. It then transfers control to the first statement following the terminated loop's endfor, end, or endwhile statement.\nTask 2: What is the difference between using an endloop statement versus continue? (2 sentence long)\nAnswer: An endloop statement terminates both the inner loop containing the endloop statement and the outer loop labeled “B” in which it is nested. On the other hand, a continue statement skips over statements in a loop but continues with the next iteration.\nTask 3: How does an endloop statement differ from a resume statement? (2 sentence long)\nAnswer: An endloop statement terminates both the inner loop containing the endloop statement and the outer loop labeled “B” in which it is nested. A resume statement can be used to terminate both the loop and the current event block.\nTask 4: What parameter does the 'endloop' statement take? (1 sentence long)\nAnswer: The endloop statement takes a character string without quotation marks as its parameter, and it cannot be a keyword.\nTask 5: Give an example of using the endloop statement to break out of multiple nested loops. (4 sentences long)\nAnswer: Breaking out of multiple nested loops can be done by labeling each loop and then use the endloop statement with the respective label. For example, breaking out of both inner while loop containing the endloop statement and the outer while loop labeled “B” in which it is nested:\n```\nB:        while condition1 do\n          /* statements */\n          while condition2 do\n               /* statements */\n               if condition3 then\n                    endloop B;\n               else\n                    continue;\n               endif;\n          endwhile\nendwhile;\n```\n"
