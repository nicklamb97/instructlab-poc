            "# Syntax\n\nThe following terminology distinctions are made when dealing with language items:\n\n- A **command** is an operation that you execute from an OpenROAD Workbench menu or at the operating system level.\n- A **statement** is an operation that you place within a program or called procedure. Statements can be written in OpenROAD 4GL, a database query language (such as SQL), or a 3GL (like C or COBOL).\n\nWhen representing language elements in *discussion text*, the following conventions are used:\n\n| Convention | Usage |\n|------------|-------|\n| UPPERCASE | Indicates constants (for example, TRUE, FALSE, and FB_DIMMED) |\n| lowercase | Indicates 4GL keywords and statements (for example, begin keyword and callproc statement) |\n| *italic, lowercase* | Indicates a variable name (for example, *cursor_variable*) |\n| MixedCase/Initial Capitalization | Indicates class names, attributes, methods, or events (for example, DataStream class, ClientData attribute, FetchRow method, and WindowResized event) |\n\nWhen representing *syntax*, the following conventions are used:\n\n| Convention | Usage |\n|------------|-------|\n| **Boldface** | Indicates keywords, symbols, or punctuation that you must type as shown |\n| *Italic* | Indicates a variable name for which you must supply an actual value\u2014this convention is used in explanatory text and syntax |\n| *Italic, underlined* | Indicates a variable name that can be used in a statement either dynamically (when you run the application) or statically (when you create the application) |\n| [ ] (square brackets) | Indicates an optional item |\n| { } (curly braces) | Indicates an optional item that you can repeat as many times as appropriate |\n| \\| (vertical bar) | Indicates a list of mutually exclusive items (that is, you can select only one item from the list) |\n\nThe following example illustrates the syntax conventions:\n\n**select** [**all** \\| **distinct**] *resultexpression*{**, ***resultexpression*} **from** *tablename* [*corrname*]{**, ***tablename* [*corrname*]} [**where** *searchcondition*] [**group by** *columnname*{**, ***columnname*}] [**having** *searchcondition*]"
