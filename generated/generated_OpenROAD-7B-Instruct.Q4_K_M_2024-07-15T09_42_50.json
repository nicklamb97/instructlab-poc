            "# C# to Actian 4GL for OpenROAD: IF-THEN-ELSE Statement FOR OpenROAD\n\n## C# Example\n\nIn this example, we have variables representing a person's age, membership status, total purchase amount, and \neligibility for a discount. The values of these variables will then be used to determine a person's eligibility for a \ndiscount.\n\n```csharp\nint age = 65;\nbool isPremiumMember = false;\ndouble totalPurchase = 120.50;\n\n// Determine membership status\nstring membershipStatus = isPremiumMember ? \"Premium\" : \"Regular\";\n\n// Determine eligibility for discount using a complex conditional expression\nbool isEligibleForDiscount = \n   isPremiumMember ? true :\n   (membershipStatus == \"Regular\" && (age > 60 || totalPurchase > 100));\n\n// Output the result\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Age: {age}\");\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Membership Status: {membershipStatus}\");\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Total Purchase: ${totalPurchase}\");\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Eligible for Discount: {isEligibleForDiscount}\");\n```\n\n### Variable Initialization\n\n- Age: The variable `age` is initialized to 65. This represents the age of the person for whom we are determining the \ndiscount eligibility.\n\n- Membership Status:\n  - The variable `isPremiumMember` is a boolean initialized to false. This indicates that the person is not a premium \n  member.\n  - The variable `totalPurchase` is initialized to 120.50. This represents the total amount the person has spent.\n\n### Determine Membership Status\n\nConditional Expression for Membership Status:\n- We use a conditional (ternary) operator to determine the membership status. The condition checks the value of \n`isPremiumMember`.\n- If `isPremiumMember` is true, the membership status is set to \"Premium\".\n- If `isPremiumMember` is false, the membership status is set to \"Regular\".\n- In this case, since `isPremiumMember` is false, the membership status will be \"Regular\".\n\n### Determine Eligibility for Discount\n\nComplex Conditional Expression for Discount Eligibility:\n- We use another conditional expression to determine if the person is eligible for a discount.\n- The first part of the expression checks if the person is a premium member (`isPremiumMember`). If this is true, the \nperson is automatically eligible for the discount, and `isEligibleForDiscount` is set to true.\n- If the person is not a premium member, the expression further checks two conditions:\n  - If the membership status is \"Regular\".\n  - If either the age is greater than 60 or the total purchase amount is greater than $100.\n- The logical AND (&&) operator ensures that the membership status must be \"Regular\" and either of the other conditions \n(age > 60 or total purchase > $100) must be true for the person to be eligible for the discount.\n- In this case `isPremiumMember` is false, `membershipStatus` is \"Regular\", `age` is 65, which is greater than 60.\n- Since the age condition is met, `isEligibleForDiscount` is set to true.\n\n### Output the Result\n\nOutput Statements:\n- We use `Console.WriteLine` to print the values of `age`, `membershipStatus`, `totalPurchase`, and \n`isEligibleForDiscount`.\n- The output will display the age of the person (65), the membership status (\"Regular\"), the total purchase amount \n($120.50), whether the person is eligible for a discount (true).\n\n## Actian 4GL Equivalent\n\n```sql\nDEFINE age INTEGER\nDEFINE isPremiumMember BOOLEAN\nDEFINE totalPurchase DECIMAL(10,2)\nDEFINE membershipStatus CHAR(10)\nDEFINE isEligibleForDiscount BOOLEAN\n\nLET age = 65\nLET isPremiumMember = FALSE\nLET totalPurchase = 120.50\n\n-- Determine membership status\nIF isPremiumMember THEN\n    LET membershipStatus = \"Premium\"\nELSE\n    LET membershipStatus = \"Regular\"\nEND IF\n\n-- Determine eligibility for discount using a complex conditional expression\nIF isPremiumMember THEN\n    LET isEligibleForDiscount = TRUE\nELSE\n    IF membershipStatus = \"Regular\" AND (age > 60 OR totalPurchase > 100) THEN\n        LET isEligibleForDiscount = TRUE\n    ELSE\n        LET isEligibleForDiscount = FALSE\n    END IF\nEND IF\n\n-- Output the result\nDISPLAY \"Age: \", age\nDISPLAY \"Membership Status: \", membershipStatus\nDISPLAY \"Total Purchase: $\", totalPurchase\nDISPLAY \"Eligible for Discount: \", isEligibleForDiscount\n```\n\nThis Actian 4GL code snippet determines a person's eligibility for a discount based on their age, membership status, \nand total purchase amount. It follows a structured approach to define variables, perform conditional logic, and output \nthe results.\n\n### Define Variables:\n- `age`: An integer variable to store the person's age.\n- `isPremiumMember`: A boolean variable to indicate whether the person is a premium member.\n- `totalPurchase`: A decimal variable to store the total amount of the person's purchase, with up to 10 digits and 2 \ndecimal places.\n- `membershipStatus`: A character variable to store the membership status (\"Premium\" or \"Regular\").\n- `isEligibleForDiscount`: A boolean variable to indicate if the person is eligible for a discount.\n\n### Initialize Variables:\n- `age` is set to 65, representing the person's age.\n- `isPremiumMember` is set to FALSE, indicating the person is not a premium member.\n- `totalPurchase` is set to 120.50, representing the total purchase amount in dollars.",
            "### Conditional Expression for Membership Status:\n- The IF statement checks if `isPremiumMember` is TRUE.\n- If TRUE, `membershipStatus` is set to \"Premium\".\n- If FALSE, `membershipStatus` is set to \"Regular\".\n- In this case, since `isPremiumMember` is FALSE, `membershipStatus` will be \"Regular\".\n\n### Complex Conditional Expression for Discount Eligibility:\n- The outer IF statement checks if `isPremiumMember` is TRUE.\n- If TRUE, `isEligibleForDiscount` is set to TRUE (premium members are always eligible for a discount).\n- If `isPremiumMember` is FALSE, it checks further conditions within the nested IF statement:\n  - It verifies if `membershipStatus` is \"Regular\" and either `age` is greater than 60 or `totalPurchase` is greater \n  than 100.\n  - If both conditions are met, `isEligibleForDiscount` is set to TRUE.\n  - If the conditions are not met, `isEligibleForDiscount` is set to FALSE.\n- In this example, `isPremiumMember` is FALSE, `membershipStatus` is \"Regular\", `age` is 65, which is greater than 60, \ntherefore, `isEligibleForDiscount` is set to TRUE.\n\n### Display Results:\n- The DISPLAY statements output the values of `age`, `membershipStatus`, `totalPurchase`, and `isEligibleForDiscount` \nto the console or user interface.\n- The output will show:\n  - The person's age (65).\n  - The membership status (\"Regular\").\n  - The total purchase amount ($120.50).\n  - The discount eligibility status (TRUE).\n\nThe code first defines and initializes the necessary variables. It determines the membership status based on whether \nthe person is a premium member. It uses nested conditional expressions to decide if the person is eligible for a \ndiscount.
