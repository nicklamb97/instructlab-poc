These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions. Here are the requirements:\n1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction should also be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.\n3. The type of instructions should be similar to provided examples.\n4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction.\n5. The instructions should be in English.\n6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n7. The output should be an appropriate response to the input and the instruction. Long outputs are preferable.\n\nBased on below document provide a list of 5 tasks:\n\nDocument:\nelse\n          overpaid = FALSE;\n     endif;\n     emptable[i].name = name;\n     emptable[i].salary = salary;\n     emptable[i].overpaid = overpaid;\n     i = i + 1;\nend\n\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n\n"

2024-07-15T17:20:32 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nInstructions:\n1. How do you declare an enumerated type in Actian 4GL?\n2. How do you define the values of an enumeration?\n3. How do you use an enumerated type as a parameter or return value from a procedure or function?\n4. How do you write a select statement that returns rows with no columns (i.e., just data)?\n5. How do you use the IN clause to test whether a variable contains one of several specified values?\n\n\nYou are asked to come up with a set of 5 diverse task instructions under knowledge->programming_languages->sql_actian_4gl for the task "Learn about the syntax of Actian 4GL SQL select statements.". These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.\n\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n'
2024-07-15T17:24:45 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n\n* Instruction\nHow can you add multiple user identifiers to a group?\n* Input\n<noinput>\n* Output\nYou can add multiple user identifies to a group by specifying them as a comma separated list in the 'users' clause of an alter group statement. For example:\nalter group sales\\_clerks\nadd users (dannyh, helent);\n\n"
2024-07-15T17:45:37 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nBased on the above document, here are three more tasks for you:\n\n1) What happens if a user tries to add themselves to a group that already has the maximum number of members allowed?\n2) How does Actian 4GL determine which user IDs to use when adding or removing users from a group?\n3) If a user is dropped from a group in an active session, what privileges do they retain until the end of that session?\n\nPlease provide detailed instructions for each of these tasks, following the guidelines provided earlier. Thank you!\n\nTask 1\n** Instruction\nWhat happens if a user tries to add themselves to a group that already has the maximum number of members allowed?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhen a user attempts to add themselves to a group that already has reached its maximum member limit, an error is thrown and processing continues with any remaining valid operations in the statement. No other changes are made to the group or its members as a result of this failure.\n\nTask 2\n** Instruction\nHow does Actian 4GL determine which user IDs to use when adding or removing users from a group?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhen adding users to a group, Actian 4GL checks the list of specified user_ids against all existing users in the system. If any duplicate user_ids are found, an error is issued and processing continues with any remaining valid operations in the statement. Similarly, when removing users from a group, Actian 4GL checks the list of specified user_ids against all existing users in the system. Any matches found result in those users being removed from the group, as well as any other changes necessary to maintain data integrity and consistency throughout the entire process.\n\nTask 3\n** Instruction\nIf a user is dropped from a group in an active session, what privileges do they retain until the end of that session?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhen a user is dropped from a group during an active session, their associated privileges are revoked immediately. However, any entitlements or authorizations previously granted to them by membership in that group remain in effect until the end of the current session. At this point, the system automatically transitions all related resources back to their default states, restoring any changes made since joining the group.\n'
2024-07-15T18:10:16 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nYou can use the drop users parameter to remove the specified user_ids from the list of users associated with the group. For example:\ndrop users (harryk, joanb, elainet);\nThis statement removes the specified user_ids from the list of users associated with the group. If a specified user_id is not in the group user list, an error is issued and processing continues with the remaining user_ids. A user cannot be dropped from a group if that group is the default group of the user. Use the alter user statement to change a user's default group.\nIf a user is dropped from a group in a session that is associated with that group, the user retains the privileges of the group until the session terminates.\n"
