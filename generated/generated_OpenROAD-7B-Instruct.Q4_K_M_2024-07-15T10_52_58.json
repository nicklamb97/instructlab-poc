        "output": "Common uses for the 'while' statement in Actian 4GL include:\n\n* Looping through a set of values. For example, if you wanted to calculate an average of all your students' grades, you could write:\n```4gl\nfor (i = 1; i <= number_of_students; ++i) {\n    total += grade(i);\n}\naverage = total / number_of_students;\n```\nThis would add up all the grades of your students and then divide that total by the number of students to give you an average grade.\n\n* Performing repetitive tasks. For instance, if you needed to create 100 records in a database, you could do so with a simple 'while' loop:\n```4gl\nfor (i = 1; i <= 100; ++i) {\n    insert_record(i, 'some data');\n}\n```\nThis would create 100 new records in the database, each with its own unique identifier (the integer i) and some default values (the string 'some data').\n\n* Testing conditions. You can also use 'while' to check if a certain condition is true or false before taking an action. For example, if you wanted to see if it was raining outside, you could write:\n```4gl\nif (rain_sensor.reading()) then \n    -- do something about the rain\nelse \n    -- do something else\nend if;\n```\nThis would read the value from your rain sensor and then decide what to do based on that information. If it is raining, it will execute the code inside the 'then' clause; otherwise, it will execute the code in the 'else' clause instead.",

        "output": "The while statement allows for repeated execution of a block of code under certain conditions. This makes it ideal for scenarios where you need to perform the same actions multiple times, such as iterating through a collection or handling errors. Additionally, the syntax is simple and easy to read, making your code more maintainable.",
