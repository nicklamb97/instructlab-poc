You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How does operator precedence work for arithmetic operators in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "The operator precedence for arithmetic operators in OpenROAD, from highest to lowest, is:\n1. `**` (Exponentiation)\n2. `*`, `/` (Multiplication and Division)\n3. `+`, `-` (Addition and Subtraction)\nOperators with equal precedence are processed from left to right. Parentheses can be used to force\nalternate precedence.\n"}
