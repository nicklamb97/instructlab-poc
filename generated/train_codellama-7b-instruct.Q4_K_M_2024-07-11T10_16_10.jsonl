In this case, if you don't set CurSession.ProcessWait=TRUE, the application will not wait for the operating system command to finish but instead will proceed immediately without knowing whether it succeeded or failed. This can lead to unintended consequences because the calling application cannot inquire about the status of the command (unless it has written any output data back into OpenROAD Actian 4GL). In such a scenario, setting CurSession.ProcessWait=TRUE is recommended to ensure that the called operating system command does not interfere with the application's intended operation."}
