Define and initialize the variables used in the examples.\n2. Determine the membership status based on whether the person is a premium member.\n3. Use conditional expressions to decide if the person is eligible for a discount.\n4. Display the results of your calculations, including any relevant data about the person or their purchase.\n5. Explain how to declare and initialize a new object in C#.\n\nNow you can test your code against these tasks!\n\nTask 1\n** Instruction\nWhat are the main variables used in the C# and Actian 4GL examples?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe main variables used in both examples are:\n- age: An integer representing the person\'s age\n- isPremiumMember: A boolean indicating if the person is a premium member\n- totalPurchase: A decimal (or double in C#) representing the total purchase amount\n- membershipStatus: A string representing the membership status ("Premium" or "Regular")\n- isEligibleForDiscount: A boolean indicating if the person is eligible for a discount\n\nTask 2\n** Instruction\nExplain how to declare and initialize a new object in C#.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn C#, you can create a new instance of any class using the \'new\' keyword followed by the object\'s name:\nobject = new ClassName(arguments);\nwhere \'ClassName\' is the name of the desired class. You can also specify constructor arguments in parentheses \nafter the class name. For example, here are some common constructors:\n- Person person = new Person(\'John\', \'Smith\');  # Creates a new Person object with the given first and last names.\n- Car car = new Car(4, \'Volvo\', \'745-ABC\');  # Creates a new Car object with the specified make, model, and \nlicense plate.\n\nTask 3\n** Instruction\nWhat are some common constructors in C#?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nSome common constructors include:\n- Person: Takes two strings as arguments for the first and last names. Creates a new Person object with those values.\n- Car: Requires an integer for the number of doors, a string for the make, and another string for the license plate \nnumber. Generates a new Car object with those specifications.\n- Database: Needs a connection string as its only argument. Opens a new database connection to the given server, \ndatabase name, and options.\n- Transaction: Requires a Database object as its first argument. Begins a new transaction on the specified database.\n'
