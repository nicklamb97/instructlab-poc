Reusability: You can call them multiple times from different parts of your code without having to write similar code again. This saves time and reduces errors while making your code more modular and easier to maintain.\n3. Readability: They help make your code more self-explanatory by providing descriptive names for their parameters and returns. For instance, when you use a custom function like 'add(a: integer, b: real)', it becomes apparent what it does and what kinds of data it requires or provides.\n4. Performance: They generally run faster than built-in methods because they are compiled into the Actian 4GL interpreter once defined in your code. This means that they can execute their logic much more efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex operations.\n5. Error handling: Custom functions can handle errors gracefully by returning appropriate values instead of crashing the program or displaying unhelpful error messages.

        "output": "To create a new field in a form, follow these steps:\n1. Open the table containing the form you want to modify.\n2. Click on the 'Fields' button at the top of the window. This will display an alphabetical list of all fields currently defined for this table.\n3. Scroll down to where you want your new field to appear. When there, simply type its name into one of the empty entry fields next to it. Actian 4GL will then automatically create the field for you with its default settings (such as size, type, and validity checks).\n4. Once created, you can modify any property of your new field by clicking on it in the Fields list or by selecting it from the menu that appears when you click on a cell in its row. For example:\n```\nmy_field = field(name='First Name');\nmy_field.size = 10; // sets the size of my field to 10 characters (or bytes).\n```",

For example, if you have an object representing a person and want to change their name, you could type:\n```\nperson.name = 'John Doe';\n```\nOr if you want to call one of their methods (such as walking), just write:\n```\nperson.walk();\n```\nYou can also use it with enums, which are similar to structures but contain only a few values instead of infinite ones. For example, when working with colors in your application, you might need to define an enumeration containing all possible shades of red. Once defined, you can use its members (such as 'red' or 'dark red') in your code without having to remember their hexadecimal codes.",
