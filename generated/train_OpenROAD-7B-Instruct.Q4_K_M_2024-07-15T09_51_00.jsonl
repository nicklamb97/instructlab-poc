Then, inside your function body, declare any local variables you need:\n                    var myVariable = 'some text';\n                        where myVariable is the name of a property or field. OpenROAD supports most common data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, enums, dates and times. You can also use simple values like NULL or false for properties that do not have an initial value set by default. Then, perform any operations on your variables or properties:\n                            myVariable.length = 3;\n                                which changes the size of the string or numeric data in it. For example, you can concatenate two strings with this syntax:\n                                    myVariable += 'and another';\n                                        which appends the text 'and another' to the end of the existing string. Similarly, you can perform arithmetic operations on numbers and booleans:\n                                            myVariable = 10 + 3;\n                                                which adds 10 to the value in the variable and then stores it back into it. You can also test conditions using logical operators like AND, OR or NOT:\n                                                    if (myVariable is not empty) {\n                                                        alert('The following text is in your variable: ' + myVariable);\n                                                        }\n                                                            which displays an alert message with the text in the variable. You can also use comparisons to determine whether two values are equal or not:\n                                                                if (myVariable < 0) {\n                                                                    alert('The value of your variable is less than zero.');\n                                                                    }\n                                                                        which checks whether the integer in the variable is less than zero and displays an alert message if it is. You can also use other logical operators like AND, OR or NOT to combine conditions:\n                                                                            if (myVariable is not empty) and (myVariable > 0) {\n                                                                                alert('The value of your variable is greater than zero.');\n                                                                                }\n                                                                                    which checks whether the string in the variable is not empty and whether its length is greater than zero and displays an alert message if both are true.

You can also test conditions using logical operators like AND, OR or NOT:\n                                                                                                                                                            if (myVariable is not empty) {\n                                                                                                                                                                alert('The following text is in your variable: ' + myVariable);\n                                                                                                                                                                }\n                                                                                                                                                                    which displays an alert message with the text in the variable. You can also use comparisons to determine whether two values are equal or not:\n                                                                                                                                                                        if (myVariable < 0) {\n                                                                                                                                                                            alert('The value of your variable is less than zero.');\n                                                                                                                                                                            }\n                                                                                                                                                                                which checks whether the integer in the variable is less than zero and displays an alert message if it is. You can also use other logical operators like AND, OR or NOT to combine conditions:\n                                                                                                                                                                                if (myVariable is not empty) and (myVariable > 0) {\n                                                                                                                                                                                    alert('The value of your variable is greater than zero.');\n                                                                                                                                                                                    }\n                                                                                                                                                                                which checks whether the string in the variable is not empty and whether its length is greater than zero and displays an alert message if both are true. OpenROAD supports all common data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, enums, dates and times. You can also use simple values like NULL or false for properties that do not have an initial value set by default."}

After that, you can access any properties or methods of this object using dot notation (.). For example:\nwrkbook.ActiveTab = 3; // Sets the active tab to the third one in the workbook.\nYou can also use literal values instead of variables when needed. Just make sure they are enclosed in quotes (''). For example:\nwrkbook.Title = 'My Sales Dashboard'; // Changes the title of the workbook to 'My Sales Dashboard'."}
