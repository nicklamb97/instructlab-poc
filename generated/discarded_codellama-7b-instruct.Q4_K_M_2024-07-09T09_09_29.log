In the above example, we are using 31 December 2023 which has 31 days in it.\nAlternatively, you can use the `day_of_month` variable directly to get the number of days for a given month like this:\n```\nday_of_month = day(month(date('2023-12')));\n```\nIn above example, we are using December 2023 as input and `month` function returns the day component for that month. Then we pass this value to `day` function which gives us the number of days in it."

Here\'s an overview of the supported operators:\n\n### Arithmetic Operators\n\nArithmetic operators combine numeric expressions into new expressions. They are:\n\n- `+`: Addition\n- `-`: Subtraction\n- `*`: Multiplication\n- `/`: Division\n- `**`: Exponentiation\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nnum_days = num_days + 30;\narea = pi * r**2;\n```\n\nOpenROAD also supports date arithmetic:\n\n```\nstart_date = start_date + \'2 days\';\n```\n\n#### Operator Precedence (highest to lowest):\n\n1. `**`\n2. `*`, `/`\n3. `+`, `-`\n\nOperators with equal precedence are processed from left to right. Use parentheses to force alternate precedence.\n\n### String Operator\n\nThe concatenation operator (`+`) joins string expressions:\n\n```\nanswer = prompt \'Please enter department for \' + name + \': \';\n```\n\n### Logical Operators\n\nLogical operators (AND, OR, NOT) join logical expressions into new boolean expressions.\n\n#### Truth Tables:\n\n**AND:**\n- True AND True = True\n- True AND False = False\n- True AND Null = Null\n- False AND False = False\n- False AND Null = False\n- Null AND Null = Null\n\n**OR:**\n- True OR True/False/Null = True\n- False OR True = True\n- False OR False = False\n- False OR Null = Null\n- Null OR Null = Null\n\n**NOT:**\n- NOT True = False\n- NOT False = True\n- NOT Null = Null\n\n#### Precedence (highest to lowest):\n\n1. NOT\n2. AND\n3. OR\n\nUse parentheses to change the order of evaluation.\n\n### Comparison (Boolean) Operators\n\nThese operators yield boolean values (TRUE, FALSE, or null with nullable expressions):\n\n- `=`: Equal to\n- `!=`, `<>`, `^=`: Not equal to\n- `<`: Less than\n- `<=`: Less than or equal to\n- `>`: Greater than\n- `>=`: Greater than or equal to\n- `is null`: Value is null\n- `is not null`: Value is other than null\n- `like`: Value matches a pattern-matching string\n- `not like`: Value doesn\'t match a pattern-matching string\n\n### Like Operator and Pattern Matching\n\nThe `like` operator compares two strings for resemblance. Syntax:\n\n```\ncharvar [not] like pattern [escape escapechar]\n```\n\nSpecial characters in the pattern:\n- `_`: Matches any single character\n- `%`: Matches any string of characters, regardless of length\n- `[]`: Matches any character within the brackets (when preceded by escape character)\n\n### Is [Not] Null Operator\n\nTests whether an expression is null. Syntax:\n\n```\nexpression is [not] null\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\nif salary is null then\n    sal_msg = \'Salary amount is unknown.\'\nendif;\n```\n\nHere are some examples to help you understand the type of questions that are asked for this document:\n'
2024-07-09T11:36:48 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nTask 1: What is the syntax for a [not] like operator in OpenROAD?\nIn OpenROAD, the `[not] like` operator checks whether a string expression matches a pattern-matching string. The following operators can be used to combine expressions:\n- `like` and `^=`.\nFor example: department_id = 10 [not] like 'DEPT-%' (check if department id is not equal to 10 or if it does not start with 'DEPT-')\nTask 2: What are the types of operators in OpenROAD?\nIn OpenROAD, there are several types of operators:\n- Arithmetic Operators: These combine numeric expressions into new expressions. Examples include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `**`.\n- String Operator: The concatenation operator (`+`) joins string expressions.\n- Logical Operators: Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) join logical expressions into new boolean expressions.\n- Comparison Operators (Boolean): These yield boolean values (TRUE or FALSE or null with nullable expressions). Examples include `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `^=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.\nTask 3: Can you give an example of a not like operator in OpenROAD?\nIn OpenROAD, the `[not] like` operator checks whether a string expression matches a pattern-matching string. For example, department_id = 10 [not] like 'DEPT-%' (check if department id is not equal to 10 or if it does not start with 'DEPT-')\n"

Here are five more instructions:\n\nTask 1\nWhat is the purpose of the `distinct` keyword in OpenROAD?\nInstruction\nExplain how to use the `like` operator in OpenROAD to search for a pattern.\nOutput\nThe `like` operator in OpenROAD is used to find a pattern in a string or column value. You can use it with the `where` clause or the `join` clause to search for patterns in columns or strings. The general syntax is: `expression [not] like pattern [escape escapechar]`. Here are some examples:\n```\nselect *\n    from departments\n    where dept_name like '[A-Z]%'\n        and salary >= 1000;\n```\nThis query selects all records from the `departments` table where the `dept_name` starts with an uppercase letter (A-Z) and the `salary` is greater than or equal to 1000.\n\nTask 2\nWhat are some ways to remove duplicate rows in a table?\nInstruction\nWrite a query that removes duplicates from a table based on two columns.\nOutput\nYou can use the `distinct` keyword in OpenROAD to remove duplicates from a table. The general syntax is: `select distinct column1, column2 ...`. Here is an example query:\n```\nselect distinct dept_id, salary\n    from departments;\n```\nThis query selects the `dept_id` and `salary` columns for unique department IDs.\n\nTask 3\nWhat are some examples of aggregate functions in OpenROAD?\nInstruction\nWrite a query that calculates the sum of salaries for each department.\nOutput\nHere is an example query:\n```\nselect dept_name, sum(salary)\n    from departments\n    group by dept_name;\n```\nThis query selects the `dept_name` and `sum(salary)` for each department. The `sum()` function calculates the total salary for each department."

Here's a sample scenario:\n```\nanswer = prompt 'Please enter department for ' + name + ': ';\n```\nThis code asks the user to enter the department and then saves it as a variable called `answer`.

For example:\n```\n'Please enter your age: ' + 30;\n```\nThis code converts the number 30 into a string by wrapping it around the `number()` function.

It works from left to right in the following way:\n\n* The pattern matching string is processed to determine the position of any percent signs, which are then replaced with an appropriate number of characters to match zero or more characters. If a nullable expression appears after a percent sign, its value is calculated first and used instead of the percent sign.\n* The character expression and the processed pattern-matching string are compared for resemblance, and the result is returned as a boolean value (TRUE if the expressions match and FALSE if they don\'t).\n```\nTask 5: Can the `like` operator be used with `not like`? Why or why not?\nYes. The `not like` operator is not an OpenROAD operator, but rather an Oracle SQL extension.'

For example, `salary is not null [not] like 'DEPT-%'` (check if salary amount is other than null and does not start with 'DEPT-')\n* Question\n* What is the syntax for a comparison operator in OpenROAD?\n* Instruction\nThe `=` operator checks whether two expressions are equal.
