It directs the flow of a program, enabling it to make\ndecisions and execute specific code segments accordingly.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the basic syntax of the IF-THEN-ELSE statement in Actian 4GL?", "assistant": "The basic syntax of the IF-THEN-ELSE statement in Actian 4GL is:\nIF condition THEN\n    statements\nELSE IF condition THEN\n    statements\nELSE\n    statements\nEND IF\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Are the ELSE IF and ELSE clauses mandatory in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement?", "assistant": "No, the ELSE IF and ELSE clauses are optional. An IF statement can be as simple as a single condition and a\nsingle block of statements to execute if that condition is true.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What type of value must conditions in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement evaluate to?", "assistant": "Conditions in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement must evaluate to a boolean value (TRUE or FALSE). Conditions are\ntypically composed of comparisons or logical expressions.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Is Actian 4GL case-sensitive when it comes to IF-THEN-ELSE keywords?", "assistant": "No, Actian 4GL is case-insensitive for keywords. So IF, if, and If are all valid. However, conventionally,\nall caps should be used for readability and consistency.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How are conditions evaluated in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement with multiple conditions?", "assistant": "Conditions in an IF-THEN-ELSE statement are evaluated in sequence from top to bottom. As soon as a true\ncondition is found, the corresponding block of statements is executed, and the remaining conditions are ignored.\n"}
