This works for simple variables as well as more complex ones, such as enumerated or referenced ones.\n"

2024-07-16T08:47:26 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nYou can create and manage objects like this:\n```\nclass Car {\n  integer model;\n  string color;\n  integer speed;\n}\n```\nIn this example, we created a class named 'Car' with three properties: an integer named 'model', a string named 'color', and an integer named 'speed'. The integer property can hold any whole number from 0 to 2147483647. The string property can store any text up to 65,535 characters long. The integer speed property represents the car's current speed in miles per hour (mph). You can set the initial values of your object's properties when you create them. For example, in this case, we set the 'model' property to zero and the 'color' property to an empty value (''). We also set the 'speed' property to its default value, which is 0 mph for this data type.\n"

You can then use this variable however you like, such as in another if statement or in a procedural statement. This allows you to access the data from your file without having to write any code to manually parse it.\n"]
